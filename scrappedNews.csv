With a gracious smile, her mother-in-law replies, ""The ceremony to make the daughter happy is held in every house, isn't it?""WHY WAS TANISHQ TROLLED FOR THE EKATVAM AD?On Twitter, certain sections, mostly Right Wing, accused the jewellery brand of promoting what they called 'Love Jihad' through the commercial video.

6,CSK VS SRH: Cricket 'very close' to life and stats can be manoeuvred - MS Dhoni ,"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni is being criticised, threatened and ridiculed for his approach towards the game but he has very simple words to say -- ""Cricket is something very close to life"".The former India captain elected to bat first after winning the toss against David Warner's Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). Notably, this would be the first time when the 'Yellow Army' will be batting first in the IPL 2020. Ahead of SRH clash they had chased the target set by the opposition teams in all their 7 matches, succeeding only twice.""Cricket is very close to life and it doesn't always go the way you want. It teaches you what you want to follow as a process.""""We're batting first. Yes, for a change. Last few games we wanted to bat first, but never got the opportunity. The thing with stats is that you can get it any way you want to. It's a process and it's quicker if the guys buy into it, and follow the process. As I said, each game will have new problems. Today it will be about how we counter the shorter boundary one on side.""CSK, after losing 5 of their 7 games, are currently sitting on the 7th spot of the 8-team IPL 2020 points table. In a similar scenario in 2010 CSK had bounced back from the position to win the title. Slater reminded of those similarities and MS Dhoni was at his wittiest best again. He reminded Slater that ""stats can be manoeuvred"" according to one's need and so his team can not just rely on that and will have to perform on the field.""2010 ended on a happy note but we can't just rely on that,"" he said.MS Dhoni also explained the reason behind the exclusion of South African spinner Imran Tahir from the playing XI yet again. The 39-year-old said that it getting difficult to form a desired team composition with Imran Tahir in it. The restricted number of foreign players allowed in the eleven was also one of the reason stated by the 3-time IPL champion.""One change - Chawla in for Jagadeesan.

11,"Ladakh standoff: China must pull back first, India remains firm on its demand","India and China have agreed to put in place a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement in Eastern Ladakh at the earliest, a joint statement said after the seventh round of Corps Commander-level talks that took place on Monday.According to sources privy to the developments in the meet, India stood firm on its stand that China must vacate areas it occupied and restore the status quo as of April 2020 before the standoff began in May.Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible, the statement said.Earlier, China had insisted that India must leave the heights it has occupied since August end on the southern bank of Pangong Lake but the Indian side maintained that since the Chinese PLA was the first to come in and occupy heights in the finger area of Pangong Lake on the northern bank they should retreat and the Indian Army will reciprocate.Since China made the first move, they should pull back first and it will be reciprocated by India, sources said. India insisted on immediate disengagement in Pangong Tso finger areas, Hotsprings and Depsang, they said.Officials said while there is a mutual decision to disengage but it still needs to be worked out how it can be implemented. There is no question of India giving up positions on the southern bank till the Chinese move back from the northern bank of the lake, said an official.In the previous meeting on September 21, India and China agreed not to send additional troops to forward areas.For the first time on Monday, the Chinese delegation included a diplomat from its foreign ministry.

12,"Unhappy over party's Bihar election management, Rahul Gandhi deputes his own team","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is reportedly unhappy with reports of irregularities in ticket distribution for Bihar Assembly election 2020. His displeasure with the Congress leadership managing Bihar Assembly election for the party led to an overhaul of poll management on Sunday.The changes in the Congress's poll management structures led to speculation that three senior party leaders have been dropped from the screening committee of the party.The Congress on Tuesday was forced to issue a strong rebuttal to such media reports that Akhilesh Prasad Singh (chairman of the campaign committee), Madan Mohan Jha (Bihar PCC chief) and Sadanand Singh (CLP leader) were dropped from the screening committee, which is tasked with shortlisting probable candidates.The denial came in a Twitter post by Congress screening committee chairman Avinash Pande. He also tagged former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his close confidant Randeep Surjewala, who was appointed the chairman of the Congress's election management and coordination committee for Bihar polls on Sunday.India Today TV has learnt that all is not well with Congress party's Bihar unit with resentment growing within the party against leaders at the helm of affairs for the Bihar Assembly election.After candidates for the first phase of Bihar election were announced, three leaders of the screening committee -- Akhilesh Prasad Singh, Madan Mohan Jha and Sadanand Singh -- came under heavy criticism by a section of party leaders.The allegation was that ticket distribution has not been fair in the Bihar Congress. This prompted Rahul Gandhi, who was displeased over the turn of events, to put his team at helm of affairs for the Bihar Assembly election.Sources say the announcement on Sunday to form six panels for the Bihar Assembly polls was the fallout of the internal tussle in the party. Akhilesh Prasad Singh was also a signatory of the controversial letter written by 23 leaders challenging the authority of the Gandhis in the party.Sunday's announcement put Randeep Surjewala in command for managing party affairs during the polls. Also, the campaign committee headed by Akhilesh Prasad Singh has now been sidelined with separate panels for publicity, media and public meetings put in place.Akhilesh Singh and Madan Mohan Jha have also been kept out of the committee headed by Surjewala, who will now be camping in Bihar to oversee poll related matters. While, other close confidants of Rahul Gandhi including Tariq Anwar, Sanjay Nirupam and Mohan Prakash have been given place in the 14-member high-power committee.The internal tussle over ticket distribution also delayed party's central election committee (CEC) meeting which was scheduled to be held on Tuesday. The Congress has so far managed to clear only 21 candidates for the first phase of polls.The Congress will be putting up its candidates on 70 seats as part of the seat-sharing deal with its grand alliance partner Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD) in the Bihar Assembly election.The Congress is also in the final stage of negotiations with the RJD over 9-10 seats which are being claimed by both the parties. The CEC will now meet on Wednesday with Congress president Sonia Gandhi chairing the meet to clear the remaining 49 seats.",2020-10-13

14,"US 'Battle Force 2045': Too little, too late to beat China ","The United States has been the leading maritime power for decades, but China's growing naval capabilities have made it the largest navy in the world.A recent report by the US Department of Defence (DoD) categorically lists how China has rapidly expanded its navy and is very close to its dream of having the largest ground force, largest navy, largest air force in the Indo-Pacific, and largest conventional missile force in the entire world.China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has more than 350 ships while the US Navy's battle force is approximately 293 ships as of early 2020. The US does not want to give up its dominance and is very closely watching China's modernisation of its armed forces.US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper recently unveiled a plan for the future navy called 'Battle Force 2045' to boost US Navy with more than 500 ships by 2045.India Today OSINT team analyses how the US plan to increase its naval power is not enough to control China's expansionist military advancements.The Congressional Research Report titled 'Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress' was recently made public. The report indicates an enhancement in the US Navy goals of 2018 policy of 355 ships to almost 500 ships.The reports emerging from the US leave most things vague and confusing about the exact numbers, although they suggest a figure between 500 and 600 ships with about 140-245 unmanned or optionally manned ships.The nuclear submarine force which is generally the most potent force of a triad expected in the 'Battle Force 2045' is likely to hover around the figure of 12, although not specified exactly.The US Department of Defence report along with the latest force structure assessments has probably forced the DoD to drastically alter its requirements within such a short period of time.The Battle Force 2045 introduces a more distributed fleet architecture so that operational necessity, technical feasibility and affordability are balanced.The report indicates that the new distributed force architecture will feature: -A smaller portion of larger ships like aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers, etc;-A larger portion of smaller ships to include corvettes, frigates, etc;-Rest of surface vessels as large as corvettes optionally manned or unmanned as a third tier.The report claims that the Battle Force 2045 would provide the US the much-required ability to project power, control the seas, and demonstrate presence as also the capability to deliver precision effects at very long ranges.The US has been pursuing the development of hypersonic technology for the last two decades as part of Global Strike programme.The weapon system that is likely to be fielded soon was tested in March 2020 indicated a successful and highly manoeuvrable weapon that can reach any part of the world within 60 minutes.The programme although thought to be conventional in nature may not take much time to convert to a nuclear system.The hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) and hypersonic cruise missiles that are being developed do not follow a ballistic trajectory but remain below the atmosphere which makes it difficult to be tracked.The speed of more than Mach 5 makes it extremely difficult to interception by the defence shields catering mainly for ballistic missiles.The US Battle Force 2045 would be depending mostly on these hypersonic systems for precision strikes anywhere in the world.China, on the other hand, is ahead of the US in this field too. The Chinese National Day Parade 2019 revealed the Dongfeng 17 (DF-17) missile with DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). It clearly indicates its deployment in PLA Rocket Force (PLARF).The DF-17 is a two-stage solid fuel rocket engine carrying a mass of 15,000 kg in an 11 m long missile which can reach 2,500 km range.The HGV DF-ZF in its last test flight has flown more than 1,400 km, suggesting a glide flight of anything between 1,500 km and 2,500 km.The Chinese PLAN has been planning to increase its submarine production for the last almost six years.China is expanding its main submarine construction facility at the Bohai shipyard with construction halls big enough to construct six submarines simultaneously.The latest satellite images of this new construction facility indicate that possibly a new construction hall appearing with two additional bays.The size of 300m x 120m with a side entrance of 80m suggests this new construction hall could assemble at least four submarines simultaneously, increasing the total capacity to construct 10 submarines simultaneously.This would put the Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry Company as the world's largest facility for submarine construction.Comparatively, the US Battle Force 2045 plan's predicted increase of 12 nuclear submarines by 2045 will be too little, too late.(Col Vinayak Bhat (Retd) is a consultant for India Today.

He smashed 77 in the 1st match and then a scintillating 108 in the final match. He was also awarded with the Player of the Series trophy.""I probably would not (compare IPL and Australia career). The way I have played international cricket, it has been more of a clearer role. I know exactly how the guys will bat around me.""My role in IPL changes probably for most games. In IPL, a lot of teams change their sides a lot. In the Australian set-up we have the same eleven for most of the games, we all know our roles really well,"" Maxwell said while talking to PTI.The Melbourne-born cricketer also explained the reason for his frequent role changes. Maxwell reckoned that teams in IPL keep looking for the correct balance and so chopping and changing becomes normal. Notably, Maxwell has played at the number 3, 4 and 5 position for KXIP in the IPL 2020. In his side's last match against KKR which they lost by 2 runs, Maxwell was sent down to bat behind an inexperienced Prabhsimran Singh. With six needed of the last ball, Maxwell smashed one towards cover but it fell just inside the boundary rope.""When you are only together for two months in the year with IPL, there is going to be chopping and changing. You are always looking for that right team balance. The team you pick at the start of the tournament might not have the balance you think as you progress.From his 7 IPL 2020 matches till now, Glenn Maxwell has scored 58 runs at an average of 14.50. His strike-rate shockingly stands at 95.08. The gun all-rounder has remained unbeaten on 3 occasions and that has come as a shock to him.""I have been not out four times (three actually) in seven games which is probably never happened to me in the history of my career. So, it has been a strange transition for me batting at five and one that I feel, I have started to become more accustomed to.""KXIP are currently at the bottom of the IPL 2020 points table.",2020-10-13

Two people in Mumbai and one in Ahmedabad have caught the virus days after being cured of it, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said.As per the World Health Organization, there are about 24 cases of reinfection across the globe.Addressing a press conference, Balram Bhargava said that the researchers were not yet sure about how many days it takes for a Covid-19 survivor to be vulnerable to the virus again. A person who catches Covid-19 infection and is then cured of it develops anti-bodies which help him/her fight the virus. However, the age of these anti-bodies is believed to be short-lived.Its 100 days or 90 days, it's still not decided even by the WHO. However, we're taking cut-off of about 100 days, the ICMR chief said.62 lakh recoveriesGiving details of the Covid-19 tally in India, Union health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that over 62 lakh people in India have recovered from Covid-19 so far, which is highest in the world. Active cases of Covid-19 in India were below 9 lakhs for the fifth consecutive day on Tuesday.The health ministry official said that the Covid-19 positivity rate in India is on a constant downward trend - the cumulative positivity rate is at 8.07 per cent, weekly rate is at 6.24 per cent and daily rate is 5.16 per cent.Around 87 per cent of people have been discharged/cured. There are 11.69 per cent active cases who are either in hospitals or under home isolation and 1.53 per cent are death cases, Rajesh Bhushan said.The worst-affected states by the Covid-19 pandemic currently are Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. We are conducting discussions with these states to figure out a way to curb the Covid-19 cases, the health ministry official said.Young casualtiesThe health ministry expressed concern over the fact that about 47 per cent of Covid-19 deaths have been recorded among those aged below 60 years.Health Ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan said about 70 per cent Covid-19 deaths have been of male patients while 30 per cent of fatalities from the infection have been reported in females.""About 53 per cent COVID-19 deaths registered among those aged 60 and above, 35 per cent in 45-60 years, 10 per cent in 26-44 years and 1 per cent each in the age-group 18-25 years and below 17 years,"" Bhushan said.Providing data on case fatality rate among different age groups with and without comorbidities, he said in the age group of 60 years and above, 24.6 per cent of deaths were of people with comorbidities while 4.8 per cent were of those without comorbidities.In the age group of 45-60 years, 13.9 per cent deaths were of patients with comorbidities while 1.5 per cent were of those without comorbidities, he said.Among the patients aged below 45 years, those with comorbidities constituted 8.8 per cent of deaths while 0.2 per cent of those who died didn't have any comorbidities, he said.The overall case fatality rate of people with comorbidities stood at 17.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent for those without comorbidities.Festival alert In view of the upcoming festivals and winter season, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr VK Paul urged people to keep following Covid-appropriate behaviour diligently such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, saying there is no reason to get lax if stability in coronavirus cases is observed.Stating that second peaks are coming up in many countries and lockdowns are being imposed, Dr VK Paul also said it is being observed that some people are becoming lenient about following the guidelines. He urged the youth to be cautious as they may infect the elderly in their families.Dr VK Paul said the novel coronavirus is a respiratory virus and these kinds of viruses attack more during the winters.People will be more prone to respiratory infections like pneumonia and influenza in the coming winter months and festive season, he said.Dr VK Paul appealed to the people to wear masks mandatorily and show no laxity on this aspect, stating that scientific estimates have shown that the pandemic can be controlled up to 36-50 per cent in this manner.",2020-10-13

22,"Coronavirus: US man gets infected twice in 48 days, 2nd infection more severe","A 25-year-old man in Nevada, US was re-infected with coronavirus and the second infection was ""more severe"" than the first one, a study published in The Lancet on Monday said.Unlike the first time when he contracted Covid-19, the patient had to be hospitalised and put on oxygen support during re-infection as he developed breathing difficulty and low blood oxygen.According to the study, the patient had no history of clinically significant underlying conditions and there were no indications that he had a compromised immunity.What did the study find?Analysing the Nevada case, experts found that the coronavirus that he had contracted on two occasions had ""significant"" genetic differences.This strongly indicates that he was infected on two occasions, and that it was not a case where the first infection re-emerged after showing a declining trend or remaining dormant for a while.In his first instance, the patient did not require hospitalisation and was kept in isolation. However, the second infection was more severe, requiring hospitalisation and oxygen support.""[He] reported symptoms that included myalgia, cough, and shortness of breath. Chest radiography showed development of patchy, bilateral, interstitial opacities suggestive of viral or atypical pneumonia,"" the study said about the patient's second infection.To confirm that samples tested on the two occasions were of the same person, experts carried out a forensic identity testing to rule out the possibility of specimen mishandling or mislabelling errors during RNA extractions. The forensic identity testing confirmed that both the samples were of the same person.The study said the patient's second infection was ""symptomatically more severe"" than the first one, which shows that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 once, ""might not guarantee total immunity"" in all cases.""All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with Covid-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2,"" the experts said.How did he get re-infected? While the exact answer to this question is still being investigated but the study notes that the time at which the Nevada patient got re-infected, coincides with his parent (who had been living with him) testing positive for Covid-19 for the first time.Researchers are analysing the parent's samples to determine if they had any role in the re-infection.""The co-habitant (parent) positive case provides a possible source for secondary exposure and reinfection of our patient,"" the study said.Why was 2nd infection more severe?Experts who studied the Nevada case said at this stage it can ""only be speculated"" what were the reasons responsible for the second infection being more severe than the first. But they however opined that it could be because:Are there any limitations to this study? Though experts have reiterated that the Nevada patient is a case of re-infection, the study does entertain a hypothetical remote scenario that it may be a case of continuous infection involving deactivation and reactivation of the virus.This possibility, the study says, is however ""highly unlikely"" because the necessary conditions required for this to happen are not visible in the present case.Akiki Iwasaki, a professor at the Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, who was not part of the Nevada study, agreed with this argument.Writing separately in The Lancet, Iwasaki noted that since the genome sequences in the samples from the first infection and re-infection differed significantly, it makes ""the chance of the virus being from the same infection small"".On the limitations of their study, the experts said they were unable to assess how the patient's immunity responded after he contracted the virus for the first time.Even on the second occasion, they were unable to fully assess the effectiveness of the immune responses when the patient was antibody-positive.While these assessments could have enriched understanding of how the patient's immunity worked in the two cases and if there was any difference in the strength of antibodies that were developed after infection in the two instances, it does not have much bearing on the primary objective of determining whether the Nevada patient was a case of Covid-19 reinfection or not.Is this the only case of Covid-19 re-infection? No.Globally, this is the fifth case of Covid-19 reinfection that has been documented in scientific literature. But it is only the second case where the reinfection was found to be more severe than the first bout.Earlier, a 46-year-old man in Ecuador was re-infected with Covid-19. His was a ""mild"" case in the first infection but became ""worse"" on the second.The Ecuador patient started developing symptoms on May 12 with intense headache and drowsiness. Seven days later, he took an RT-PCR test and tested positive for Covid-19 on May 20.Over the next few days, his symptoms improved and a second test on June 3 found him negative.However, in mid-July, he again started developing Covid-like symptoms after being exposed to a relative who too had Covid-19. The patient tested positive for the second time on July 22 but this time his symptoms were more severe and included odynophagia (pain in throat while swallowing), nasal congestion, fever of 38.5°C, strong back pain, productive cough, and dyspnea (shortness of breath).He however did not require hospitalisation and tested negative in another RT-PCR test conducted on August 4.The first confirmed reinfection case was reported in Hong Kong in August when a 33-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19, 142 days after his first confirmed infection and subsequent declaration that he has recovered.Nearly a week later, Covid-19 reinfection cases were also reported in the Netherlands and Belgium.What are the implications of re-infection? 'Immunity' has been one of the buzzwords among health experts, government officials and media discussions ever since the coronavirus pandemic made international headlines.Though researchers world over are developing hundreds of vaccines to fight Covid-19, their best bet still remains the hope that people who have once been exposed to the virus and contracted the disease, develop sufficiently strong immunity that it would shield them from reinfection.While it has been evidenced that exposure to Covid-19 provides immunity against reinfection, but it is not yet clear how strong this immunity can be, how long it can last and the degree to which it can shield the person from contracting Covid-19 again.Studies on other coronaviruses in the past have shown that immunity from reinfection can last between 1-3 years. But nothing concrete is known about the novel coronavirus.It is in this context that the confirmed cases of reinfection pose a question mark on our existing understanding of the virus and the antibodies that our bodies produce after being infected.This is one of the factors that have made governments cautious about the proposal of trying to develop herd immunity by exposing their populations to the virus in the hope that once most of them have contracted the disease, society as a whole will develop immunity against it.Reacting sharply to advocates of this theory, the World Health Organisation on Monday said such proposals are ""simply unethical"".""Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.""For example, herd immunity against #measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated.For #polio, the threshold is about 80%""-@DrTedros""Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak,"" Tedros said adding that the world still knows only a little about immunity against Covid-19 to know whether herd immunity is even achievable.Tedros said the WHO has documented instances of people becoming re-infected with coronavirus after recovering from the first instance. He added that while most people appear to develop some kind of immune response, it is unclear how long that lasts or how robust that protection is.""In other words, herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it""-@DrTedros #COVID19 https://t.co/thAf05jrT3Commenting on the Nevada patient's case in The Lancet, Akiki Iwasaki, said we need to keep in mind that the cases of reinfection that are being identified in general are those where the patient has shown symptoms. The detection of re-infection cases thus suffers from a detection bias of symptomatic cases.In other words, there could be many asymptomatic cases of reinfection but they are not being identified due to limited testing capacities.""Due to the paucity of broad testing and surveillance, we do not know how frequently reinfection occurs among individuals who recovered from their first infection,"" Iwasaki writes.""Asymptomatic reinfection cases can only be picked up by routine community testing or at an airport and we are probably severely underestimating the number of asymptomatic reinfections.""As research on coronavirus and vaccine development progresses, experts will also have to find answers to why some patients get reinfected while most don't, and why some cases of reinfection are milder while the others are more severe, among others.ALSO READ | Humans spreading Covid to animals? 10,000 minks dead at US farm, experts say virus spread from usALSO READ | Covid-19 is leaving cured patients with brain fogALSO READ | How long can coronavirus survive on surface?

27,Aishwarya Rai in talks for Tamil remake of Andhadhun,"Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is likely to play one of the leads in the Tamil remake of hit Bollywood film, Andhadhun, which marks actor Prashanth's comeback in Kollywood. Earlier this year, Prashanth's father and producer Thiagarajan announced that he will be bankrolling Tamil remake of Ayushmann Khuranna's Andhadhun and the film will be directed by Mohan Raja of Thani Oruvan fame.The latest update is that Mohan Raja has opted out of the project due to reasons best known to the makers. JJ Fredrick, who made his debut in Tamil industry with Jyotika's Ponmagal Vandhal, has been roped in as the director of the film. Interestingly, we hear that Aishwarya Rai has been approached to play Tabu's character in the Tamil version of Andhadhun.When IndiaToday.in contacted the producer of the film, Thiagarajan, he said, ""We are in talks with Aishwarya Rai. However, she is yet to sign the project."" If this happens, Aishwarya Rai and Prashanth will be working together again after almost 22 years.The two have earlier shared screen space in Shankar's blockbuster Tamil film, Jeans, which released in 1998.A few months ago, there were also reports that veteran actor Karthik and comedian Yogi Babu have been finalised to play key roles in the film.

28,"Less than 10% Indian men involved in household chores, shows latest survey ","That there's a gendered division of labour in India is something well known - and evident from looking around virtually every household, and to some extent, workplaces. But just how unequal it is was hard to quantify, until now.Countries around the world use Time Use Surveys to assess the share of time in a day groups of people spend on different activities. India's last such survey was in 1999-2000. Then from January to December 2019, the National Statistical Office conducted the Time Use in India - 2019 survey, and released the results late last month.The survey uses a nationally representative sample of over 4.5 lakh people over the age of six, to whom questions were asked about how they spend their days.Data shows women are overwhelmingly involved in work they do not get paid for. Some 84 per cent of women's working hours are spent on activities they do not get paid for, while for men, the reverse is true - 80 per cent of their work time is spent on activities they get paid for.Spending the majority of their time in employment does reduce the hours available for men to spend on unpaid domestic chores, but the problem goes beyond mere time availability.Just 6.1 per cent men participate in cooking, even if only for a few minutes in a day, but 87 per cent men participate in leisure activities. Among adult women aged 15-59, however, the vast majority participate in some cooking every day. Just 8 per cent men participate in house cleaning and just 3 per cent in washing clothes.""In places where patriarchal norms around division of labour are rigid, they create gendered spaces within the household. In many such households, if a man walks into the kitchen, it is considered odd or wrong. It isn't paid work that is preventing them from sharing household work,"" Ashwini Deshpande, professor of economics at Ashoka University and a leading feminist labour economist.This leaves women with little time to socialise - or even sleep. The average woman, aged 15-59, gets 13 minutes fewer sleep at night each day, but catches up by grabbing a nap at odd hours. Women in their working ages also get less time to socialise, eat and drink, and even bathe and get dressed.The disparities begin from a young age. The average male child, aged 6-14, gets to spend more of his day on leisure and learning than his sisters, while the average girl has to spend more time on housework than her brothers. Boys are also much less likely to participate, even if only for a few minutes, on regular household chores, including cooking, cleaning and washing.",2020-10-13

Its just been nine days but Bigg Boss has delivered a complete mixture of twists and turns.In the latest clip of Bigg Boss Extra Masala on Voot, Rahul Vaidya is seen speaking to Rubina Dilaik about marriage in general. He then moves on to name the singer he would like to have perform at his wedding.In a candid conversation with Rubina Dilaik, Rahul Vaidya says, Meine socha hua hai, I think mein jabse perform karta aaraha hu na, shaadiyon mein nachana bahut hi mushkil hai aur woh bhi non-stop. He further adds, isliye mein Daler Mehndi ji ko bulaunga, uss level par who aagaz karte hai jaha par who khatam horaha hota hai (Since the time I have been performing, I think it is very difficult to dance in weddings, and that too non-stop.

Pavitra was the one to give Rahul Vaidya a kiss, which helped him complete his secret task. Rahul had also told Pavitra that he would like to learn cooking from her, as nothing is more romantic than a man who cooks for his woman and he always wanted to learn cooking.

31,"CSK vs SRH: MS Dhoni not adamant with his decisions, says Pragyan Ojha","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) are all set to play their 8th game of the IPL 2020 agaisnt Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Dubai on Tuesday and a loss here will mean that they will deplete their play-off chances further in the 13th edition of the cash-rich league. CSK's batting-unit apart from their opener against Mumbai Indians and the one game against KXIP which they won by 10 wickets have failed to strike in the rest of their 5 chases.MS Dhoni's model of taking the match deep and going berserk in the final few overs have also failed miserably in UAE. MS Dhoni's batting position has also been a constant topic of debate. In CSK's last match against RCB, team's openers Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson had gone back to the pavilion inside 6 overs and a there was good opportunity for MS Dhoni to walk in and guide his team's inning but debutant Narayan Jagadeesan was sent to bat ahead of him. CSK lost the match by 37 runs and people questioned the tactics of the former India captain all over again. Some thought that he was just to adamant with his style of functioning.However, in the post-match presentation ceremony, MS Dhoni had himself admitted that his mode of chasing the targets should be done away with. His former India teammate Pragyan Ojha has also reckoned that MS Dhoni is not someone who is arrogant and adamant with his decisions and instead he is ready to do whatever is better for the team.Talking exclusively to Sports Today on Tuesday, Ojha said that Dhoni's nature of addressing the current situation is what makes him different from others. Pragyan Ojha added that the Ranchi-born wants all the decisions made to be in the best interest of the team.""That's what makes him different from others. He always tries to address the current situation. If he thinks something will help the team's cause he will definitely do it. He is not adamant, he is never arrogant about his decisions. He believes that the decision taken by the team and the management should be in the best interest of the team,"" Pragyan Ojha told on Sports Today.CSK has usually batted slow in the first half of the run-chase and that has definitely put an additional pressure on the team which is already feeling the absence of batting prowess of their vice-captain Suresh Raina, who decided to opt out of the IPL 2020 season.MS Dhoni himself wants to do away with his model of chasing""Batting has been a bit of a worry and today also it was evident. We need to do something about it. We can't just keep turning up... It is almost the same thing that is happening maybe the individuals are different but I think we are better off playing the other way round - play the big shots and even if you get out and it is fine because we can't leave too many after the 15th or 16th over,"" Dhoni said after CSK's loss versus RCB""Our batting has lacked a bit of, you can say, power more from the 6th over onwards, individuals get tentative and no matter how much confidence you are giving them, ultimately they have to have their own plan as to how to play. We have not been able to adapt and plan for bowlers bowling from 6-14 overs,"" he had added.""CSK is answerable to their fans""Pragyan Ojha recalled the IPL 2018 season when all the home matches of CSK were shifted to Pune because of protests in the city due to Cauvery issue. Ojha said than fans from Chennai took trains to Pune to support their team and the fandom of CSK is something which cannot be taken ""out of the equation"". The former India spinner said CSK are answerable to their fans and should win matches for them.""There was something going on in Chennai and so fans were not allowed a couple of years ago. A lot of fans took trains to travel to Pune and they were there. It shows what kind of following Chennai have got and thats the reason we all are hopeful that Chennai will win. Cricket is all about fans and when you talk about Chennai you can not take the fans out of the equation and this game will be special for those fans. CSK is answerable to those fans.",2020-10-13
32,CSK count on miracle in IPL 2020 as the humble ghost of 2010 resurfaces,"Cricket is all about uncertainties and thats what makes the miracle of a sport so great in this world. In fact, fans of the sport refuse to believe that theres anything more magical in the world than cricket. And why wouldnt they? Anything can happen in the sport at any given time. And Chennai Super Kings, the 2nd most successful team in the Indian Premier League, have seen it all.In July 2015, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals became the two IPL franchises to be banned from the cash-rich cricket league for two years. Their reinstatement in the marquee T20 league, ahead of the 2018 edition, marked a revolution in the league. MS Dhoni back in CSK colours was the biggest day for many fans across the globe. Dhonis CSK went on to win their 3rd IPL title that year, proving it to the world that anything can happen in the premises of cricket.But this year has been disappointing for the fans, to say the least. With only 2 wins out of 7 IPL 2020 fixtures so far, CSK are placed at 7 in the points table only above KXIP. However, theres a ray of hope since the ghosts from CSKs past, precisely IPL 2010, have raised some hope for the reduced CSK side that is struggling to make a mark. IPL 2010 was the first time that MS Dhonis CSK had emerged as champions of the season and this season, according to how things stand halfway of the edition, is no different from the ongoing 2020 edition.IPL 2010 vs IPL 2020: A generous points table analysis and similarities that seem like a work of miracle.3rd season CSK since their reinstatement in the IPL: CSK were reinstated in the 2018 edition and IPL 2020 is indeed their 3rd season since they were reincarnated.CSK are placed 7th at mid-season: Just like in the 2010 edition, CSK are yet again on the penultimate position of the IPL points table and most fans are hoping for a miracle to happen.Mumbai Indians are topping the table: Rohit Sharmas Mumbai Indians have found their way to the top of the table, beating Delhi Capitals with a better NRR, just like Sachin Tendulkars side did in IPL 2010.KXIP placed at the bottom with one win: Kumar Sangakkaras Kings XI Punjab, just like KL Rahuls side this year in IPL 2020, were place at the absolute bottom of the points table with just one win.2 teams, SRH and RR, are tied with 6 points: Just as Deccan Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2010 were tied at 6 points each, this time as well Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals seem to be on the same boat in the 13th edition of the cash-rich event.Looking beyond these similarities, just to be more accepting of the reality, MS Dhoni is 10 years older than he was in 2010 and lost the charisma of the best finisher in the world that he used to be. CSKs side has been short of mainstays Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh and the senior pack of players have not been at their best. A miracle can still happen and while the fans can rely on it, the management definitely cant.",2020-10-13
33,Yellove in Cuddalore: Die-hard Dhoni fan paints his house in CSK colours,"At a time when many are criticising MS Dhoni for the way he has been playing, and how Chennai Super kings are struggling in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 in UAE, a die-hard fan of the former India captain has coloured his house in the CSK color yellow.The house is coloured yellow and even has portraits of Dhoni on the front walls. The side wall has the CSK logo and the tag line ""Whistle Podu"" on it. Gopikrishnan spent Rs 1.50 lakh to paint the house in this way.Gopikrishnan is a resident of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu but has been working in Dubai for several years now. He makes sure to attend every CSK match in the city but now due to Covid 19, Gopikrishnan is in his hometown of Cuddalore and is unable to watch the matches live at the stadium because of the pandemic.I am disappointed that I cant see Dhoni playing live, and also how many people are criticising Dhoni for not playing well.

This is the first time in 10 years that Dhoni's team is placed 7th almost at the half-way mark in the tournament.Dhoni himself has been woefully out-of-form with scores of 0*, 29*, 15, 47*, 11, 10, along with the other top-order batsmen in the team barring Faf du Plessis.Chennai Super Kings enjoy immense popularity all over India, especially down South, but their horror run has led to numerous memes and trolls on social media.They have become the butt of all jokes this season with the players and their families even receiving threats and abuses online. CSK needs some inspiration from somewhere to bring their campaign back on track otherwise this could be the first time in history that they fail to reach the playoffs of IPL.CSK will take on David Warner's Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Match 29 of IPL 2020 on October 13. One more loss might spell doom for Dhoni's CSK, who are just above Kings XI Punjab on the table with 4 points and a net run-rate of -0.588.",2020-10-13

35,Singapore Airlines offers tourists meals inside Airbus A380,"Meals on the tarmac are currently the new big favourite of passengers, who are missing being on a flight right now.People are paying the equivalent of a budget ticket just to dine inside grounded airplanes. And this in turn is becoming a great hit with the novel-coronavirus-battered Singapore Airlines, who has turned its grounded planes into a pop-up restaurant.HOW MUCH DOES THE MEAL COST?Passengers are paying quite hefty amounts to dine inside grounded Airbus A380, which is the world's biggest passenger jet. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), people have to pay a sum of up to SGD 642 (Rs 34,645) to have a meal on board the airline.Reportedly, the most expensive option is a four-course meal in a first-class suite, while the cheapest costs SGD 53 (Rs 2,858) and consists of a three-course meal in economy class.SEATS WERE SOLD OUT IN 30 MINUTESMoreover, people were so eager to have airplane food that all the 900 seats for lunch on October 24 and 25 were sold out within half an hour of opening the bookings on Monday, according to AFP.After the overwhelming demand, the carrier extended the days and announced that the restaurant will stay open for two more days. Additionally, lunch and dinner will be offered on all four dates.To follow the social distancing guidelines, about half the seats will be left empty on the double-decker jets, parked at Changi Airport.Reprotedly, Singapore Airlines has also started home deliveries of airplane meals for those seeking to bring the in-flight experience into their living rooms.With the aviation industry in deep crisis due to the pandemic, this seems like a great alternative to raise cash, said AFP. Recently, the airline had also decided to start its 'flights to nowhere' service (short journeys starting and ending at the same airport). However, they ditched it following an outcry over the potential environmental impact.Not long ago, Thai Airways had also opened a pop-up airplane-themed restaurant at their headquarters in Bangkok.ALSO READ: Paris hotel drains swimming pool to convert it into a restaurantALSO READ: You can enjoy a heritage cruise ride on the Hooghly river in Kolkata",2020-10-13
36,Salman Khan was not the first choice for Prem in Maine Pyar Kiya,"Salman Khan is back to the small screen to enthral his audience once again with Bigg Boss 14. Now, Salman Khan's popularity and demand can be gauged from the fact that the makers of Bigg Boss 14 had to really loosen their purse strings in order to afford the actor. If news reports are to be believed, Salman is charging a whopping Rs 20 crore per episode this year, which adds up to Rs 450 crore for the entire season. But then, this kind of popularity wasn't achieved in a day. It actually started with his debut film, Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). However, did you know that Salman Khan was not the first choice for the role of Prem?Well, before Salman Khan eventually got the role of Prem, a number of new actors were considered and auditioned for the role. You will be surprised to know who the actors were and will thank God that Salman Khan was chosen instead. Vindu Dara Singh, Deepak Tijori and Piyush Mishra were some newcomers that were queuing up for the role of Prem.VINDU DARA SINGH WAS CONSIDERED FOR DARA SINGH'S REPUTATIONVindu is the son of the celebrated wrestler Dara Singh, who made a special place for himself in the industry because of his humble nature. Vindu was preparing to make his Bollywood debut and the makers were keen to consider him because of Dara Singh's reputation and goodwill.DEEPAK TIJORI TRIED TO MAKE HIS MARKOn the other hand, Deepak Tijori was also toiling away to make a name for himself in the industry. He made his debut with the 1990 film Aashiqui and went on to do small roles in other films. His breakthrough role came in Aamir Khan's 1992 release, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, in which he played the character of Shekhar Malhotra.PIYUSH MISHRA WAS SOORAJ BARJATYA'S FAVOURITEIt may sound surprising to many but acclaimed actor Piyush Mishra was also offered the role of Prem. However, he didn't turn up for audition. Director Sooraj Barjatya was keen on signing him for the lead role. ""I really don't know why I did not do Maine Pyar Kiya. Director Suraj Barjatya had called me. I did not go. The lead actress, Bhagyashree, was already selected. The lead actor wasn't final. Barjatya wanted to launch me. I looked good those days. But I really do not know why I did not take the offer. I am not a fool to let an opportunity like this pass. People say I didn't do it for my love for theatre but that is not true. I should have done it,"" Piyush Mishra said on the first day of the three-day literature festival, Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018, in New Delhi on Friday.As it goes, destiny had its own plans.SALMAN KHAN BAGGED THE ROLE IN THE ENDWhile in the end, Salman Khan was chosen to play the iconic role, it was not all easy-peasy for the star. In fact, he was rejected by Sooraj Barjatya after his first audition. The filmmaker thought that Salman looked small. When he first came to my office, I remember he was sitting at the reception and he looked very small. It (was) the second audition that we liked and we finalised him, Sooraj was quoted as saying.Watch Salman Khan and Bhagyashree in the song Dil Deewana from Maine Pyar Kiya here:Well, we now truly believe that all's well that ends well.

38,Covid-19 is leaving cured patients with brain fog,"Brain fog is being intensely debated around the globe as a post-Covid-19 symptom among patients who have recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Brain fog is a medical condition when a patient complains about troubling cognitive symptoms.Confusion, delirium, difficulty in concentration, dizziness, problems in grasping routine conversations, and memory loss are among a set of complaints that several recovered Covid-19 patients have made after they were declared cured of the novel illness. The scientists have warned about this phenomenon for several months.A new study conducted by the US-based Indiana University School of Medicine covering nearly 4,000 Covid-19 survivors has found that more than 50 per cent of the people had one or the other form of brain fog, which medically is a collective term for a list of over 100 physical neurological and psychological symptoms that make it difficult for a person to carry on day-to-day routine work.A fairly large number of Covid-19 survivors have found it difficult to function at their workplace as they did earlier. Healthcare workers have been reported to face difficulties in recalling what a patient complained about only a minute ago. Some Covid-19 survivors have complained that they felt like they were suffering from dementia.COVID-19 AND BRAIN IN PAST RESEARCHThe Indiana University's survey is not the first to highlight the functional disability of brain due to Covid-19. In August, France's University of Paris had found that around 34 per cent recovered Covid-19 patients complained of memory loss.Another 28 per cent said they had difficulty in concentrating on the work they did and around 31 per cent reported sleep disorder. The French study said these symptoms persisted for up to four months after recovery from Covid-19. However, that study was conducted on a smaller group of 120 Covid-19 survivors.Another study found that though Covid-19 is considered primarily a respiratory illness, its causative agent the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus attacks the brain. It was highlighted by experts from the John Hopkins University.Researchers have found indications that the novel coronavirus infects the brain to make copies of the brain cells to ""steal"" away oxygen and starve the brain cells to death. This leaves the patients with headache, confusion and delirium.WHY IS IT HAPPENING?The intriguing part of this post-Covid-19 inability to focus on work is not yet fully explained. The scientists working on the viral infection have underlined that these symptoms are more common among patients in days immediately after they were discharged from hospitals. This could mean that the patients with brain fog possibly required longer hospitalisation.The growing speculation among the scientific community about the brain fog condition among Covid-19 survivors is that it is triggered by ""persistent immune activation"". SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is new to human body prompting the immune system of some individuals to overreact leading to inflammation of blood vessels and also a condition called encephalopathy, which alters mental function of a person.STUDIES FIND MORE SYMPTOMSTwo more studies conducted recently in the US and Spain have also found that Covid-19 patients continue to complain about persistence of symptoms weeks and months after they have recovered.Researchers in Spain found over 75 per cent patients having long-lasting symptom, most common of which being dyspnoea, which is shortness of breathing.According to them, neurological symptoms -- occurring in about one in every 10 patients -- were the most frequent complaints after respiratory symptoms among Covid-19 survivors. Reduced lungs function was another major symptom among them.In the US, the researchers found ""anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnoea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia"" as the most common symptoms among Covid-19 survivors.Anosmia is the loss of ability to differentiate one smell from the other, or total loss of sense of smell. Ageusia is the loss of ability to detect taste. Tachycardia is the medical term for a condition that makes heart beat irregularly and rapidly, usually more than 100 beats per minute.",2020-10-13
39,"IPL 2020: MS Dhoni has to bat higher up against SRH, says Sehwag ","It is almost a do-or-die battle for the Chennai Super Kings against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in Dubai on Tuesday.The MS Dhoni-led team is languishing at the 7th spot on the points table with just two wins in seven matches in IPL 2020.With very little margin for error in their following matches, the team will have to win at least 5 of their next 7 matches, and still hope for other factors to go in their favour if they want to make it to the playoffs for IPL 2020.With all the cricket analysts around the world talking about how CSK can turn things around from here, former India batsman Virender Sehwag simply feels that one of the important steps in that direction has to be for the skipper MS Dhoni to push himself up the batting order.MS Dhoni needs to stop thinking about other players. He needs to first think about himself, and come into bat higher up. You cannot just go on promoting other batsmen up the order. For CSK to win, Dhoni will have to bring himself up the order, said Virender Sehwag on his Facebook channel titled Viru Ki Baithak.Rayudu needs to improve his strike rate, says SehwagThe Sultan of Multan also felt that other batsmen need to take more responsibility and pointed out that batsman Ambati Rayudu needs to improve his strike rate.Shane Watson and Faf du Plessis are under constant pressure that if they dont give CSK a good start, the rest of the team will not be able to get them to a good score.Rayudu has to understand that in T20 cricket, the game ends after 20 overs, and he cant start hitting in the 20th over, Sehwag said.In terms of their bowling, Sehwag felt that CSK are doing pretty well with Shardul Thakur finding form in the last few games, but said that Sam Currans last match was an area of concern as Virat Kohli smashed him all over the park.Sam Curran was jolted by RCBs Virat Kohli in the last match, so maybe this time around MS Dhoni will think of replacing him for the final overs by Deepak Chahar, said Sehwag.",2020-10-13
40,Bihar election 2020: Too many CM hopefuls in the race for Pataliputra throne,"With elections in Bihar just days away, voters seem to have no dearth of chief ministerial hopefuls in the state. Though the major contest is going to be between the National Democratic Front and Mahagathbandhan, at least three other alliances have cropped up. These comprise smaller parties with marginal vote banks, but are led by highly ambitious leaders, who promise to play spoilsport in Bihar's traditionally bipolar electoral contests.The NDA, led by Nitish Kumar, comprises JD(U), BJP, Hindustani Awam Morcha and Vikassheel Insaan Party. The last two, led by Jitan Ram Majhi and Mukesh Sahni, were earlier part of Mahagathbandhan, but switched camps a few days back.The Mahagathbandhan, led by Tejashwi Yadav, has RJD as the key alliance partner, along with Congress and Left parties such as CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML).Apart from this, Upendra Kushwaha, who has had brief stints with both the NDA and UPA in Bihar, has formed a front of his own. His Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) has tied up with Mayawati's BSP and Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM; the alliance is called Grand Democratic Secular Front.Kushwaha recently walked out of the Mahagathbandhan after it refused to declare him the CM candidate. He is now trying to impress voters that he would make a better CM than Nitish or Tejashwi.The front, which will be targeting mostly OBC, Dalit and Muslim votes, has three more constituents, including former Union minister Devendra Yadav's Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic).A fourth front - Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) - has also been formed by Jan Adhikar Party convenor and former MP Pappu Yadav, who has tied up with the Azad Samaj Party of Chandrashekhar Azad 'Ravan'. Pappu Yadav also wants to woo the Yadav and Dalit voters of Bihar.There is also a fifth front in Bihar - United Democratic Alliance (UDA) - led by another former Union minister, Yashwant Sinha. This front has given a new lease of life to many marginalised political leaders like Sinha himself.In the last 15 years, Bihar has more or less witnessed a bipolar contest between the NDA and an RJD-led front. The constituents of these alliances, however, keep on changing or switching camps.In 2015, Nitish and Lalu were together in the Mahagathbandhan, but then too, it was a bipolar contest with the NDA, comprising BJP, LJP, RLSP and HAM. This time, LJP (Lok Janshakti Party), led by Chirag Paswan, continues to be an ally of BJP at the Centre, but refused to be part of the coalition in Bihar over differences with Nitish. The LJP is going alone and Chirag has promised to field candidates against all the JD(U) contestants.But whether the numerous alliances will confuse voters or spell the death knell for certain political leaders will only be known on November 10. Bihar goes to polls in three phases starting October 28.""This time, many smaller parties have formed an alliance. One thing common between them is that their leaders are very ambitious, but are detached from the masses. The beauty of Indian democracy is that any citizen can contest elections even if they are independent. All these parties are in the electoral fray to try their luck but the main contest is only between the NDA and Grand Alliance,"" said JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha.""All these coalitions by smaller parties will end on November 10. There is no confusion among people and they have made up their mind that the Grand Alliance government has to be formed and Tejashwi Yadav has to be CM. These smaller parties are at best vote-cutters,"" RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.But unlike many other states, Bihar's electoral outcome is unique where around 25 per cent of the votes are still pocketed by small parties and independents. However, it remains to be seen whether this vote share can be converted into seats this time.",2020-10-13

The video left Twitter divided, with some people agreeing that it was indeed a scary scene, and some saying that the man was in the animal's territory so her reaction was justified.See some of the reactions:No, she didn't.

65,"Andhra: Woman set on fire for rejecting man's advances pulls accused into fire, both die","A woman died after a man, infatuated with her, burned her alive after she rejected his advances in Andhra Pradesh's Vijayawada. The incident took place in Hanumanpet, Parcel centre, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh.Agitated over the rejection, the man set the woman on fire after pouring petrol on her. The woman died on the spot due to severe burn injuries.The victim was a nurse by profession and worked at a coronavirus care centre in Vijayawada.Police said that the victim held on to the man as she was burning and as a result the accused also suffered 80 per cent burns and later succumbed to his injuries at the Government General Hospital in Guntur.According to local police, the couple had been in a relationship for the past four years but some months ago the woman decided to end the relationship.

68,Don't need Hindutva certificate: Uddhav on Guv's letter asking him to open places of worship,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday responded strongly to a letter sent to him by state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The governor requested Uddhav Thackeray to reopen religious places of worship in the state in his letter.Koshyari wrote: You have been a strong votary of Hindutva. You had publicly expressed your devotion for Lord Ram. You had visited, Vitthal Rukmani Temple on Ashadi Ekadashi.I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worships time and again or have you suddenly turned secular? Koshyari asked in the letter.In response, Uddhav Thackeray said, I don't need a certificate from you about my Hindutva.Further taking a dig at the state administration, Bhagat Singh Koshyari said it is ironical that the Maharashtra government has reopened bars and restaurants but has not taken a call on reopening religious places of worship.It is ironical that on one hand, the government has opened up bars and restaurants but on the other hand, gods and goddesses have been condemned to stay in the lockdown, Koshyari wrote.Giving an example of Delhi, he said the religious places have been reopened in the national capital in June, but added that no surge in Covid-19 cases have been reported from any of these places of worship.I request you to announce forthwith the reopening of all the places of worship with necessary Covid-19 precautions, Koshyari added.Governor faces heat over letter Soon after Bhagat Singh Koshyari's letter started doing rounds on social media site Twitter, he was criticised by many leaders including Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi.She said, ""A governor swears by the constitution while taking oath to the chair but is now having a problem with what is to be followed by the very same constitution?""""Was the letter drafted as a BJP member?

75,"Delhi air quality worsens as farm fires rage, farmers blame govts for no solution","It is that time of the year again. Farm fires are back and on the rise. The air quality of Delhi is deteriorating every day and residents are struggling to breathe.Delhi recorded its worst air quality since February on October 12 as the concentration of fine particulate matters PM2.5 and PM10 increased to their highest recorded levels this season.With no relief in sight, stubble burning is back in all its raging ferocity ahead of the harvesting season. Satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) have shown that farmers are burning the crop residue in parts of Punjab and Haryana.The first six days of October saw a five-time rise in the number of stubble-burning incidents in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh as compared to the corresponding period last year, official data shows.As the AQI continues to decline in Delhi, cases of crop burning are rampant, the air is polluted and smoke billowing from fields is commonplace in Amritsar.Like every year, it is farmer versus the government yet again on the issue of stubble burning.The government, be it the Congress or the Badals [SAD], doesnt provide any help to farmers. The main reason farmers resort to crop burning is because help has to come to us, says Happy Singh, a farmer from AmritsarGurbhajan Singh Chabba, a farmer leader, said, It is easy to give bytes on camera and quotes in newspapers but take a look around and you will realise that the government just wants to penalise the farmer without giving any help.The governments, meanwhile, has a different story to tell.The Punjab government has said it has been utilising crop residue through biomass-based power plants. Officials say while 7,378 custom hiring centres (CHCs) have been set up, another 5,200 are in process. CHCs are outlets that offer farm machinery on hire to farmers.The Haryana government has said it has set up 2,879 CHCs while 2,000 more will be established by October-end. The state government also said that a committee has been set up to look into the progress of bio-CNG and bio-ethanol projects to manage crop residue.Harpreet Singh Sidwa, a farmer told India Today, From the moment we get government support, we will stop burning stubble. Who wants black fields and depleted nutrients but just blaming farmers for pollution is not the solution. There are other industries which contribute majorly to Delhi pollution but unfortunately, farmers have now become the easy target.""Delhi minister Gopal Rai has said the AAP government is in touch with Punjab and Haryana governments regarding the stubble burning issue.Also Read | Delhi's records worst air quality since February as farm fires continue in Punjab, HaryanaAlso Read | Farm fires may spike Covid cases, mortality, warn expertsAlso Watch | Tracking stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana",2020-10-13
76,Bihar election: Can Owaisi's poll engineering with Kushwaha challenge Nitish Kumar?,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is seeking his fourth straight electoral victory in the Bihar Assembly election 2020. Among other rivals, the Bihar Assembly election this time sees a new experiment -- by two community-based parties led by Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha -- challenging Nitish Kumar in his quest to win a fresh mandate.Asaduddin Owaisi and Upendra Kushwaha have partnered to form the the Grand Democratic Secular Front. The coalition has decided to contest all 243 seats.Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Mayawati, Samajwadi Janata Dal (SJD) of former Union minister Devendra Prasad, the Janwadi Party (Socialist) of Dr Sanjay Chauhan and the Suheldeo Bharatiya Samaj Party of Om Prakash Rajbhar are constituents of the coalition.The AIMIM banks on Muslim votes for its electoral success. The RLSP drives its political power from its reach in the Kushwaha-Koeri-Kurmi community. These three castes are often spoken of in the same social-electoral bandwidth in Bihar. The BSP calls itself the champion of the Dalit cause. Similarly, the other parties of the coalition have limited political appeal in Bihar.CASTE CALCULUSOwaisi has invested much of his energy in Bihar since the 2014 Lok Sabha election. He has held meetings with Muslim opinion leaders and campaigned in areas where their population share is big. The campaign brought success to Owaisi's AIMIM when it won a bypoll in Bihar in 2019 in Kishanganj.Muslims account for around 17 per cent of Bihar's population. In some districts such as Kishanganj (68 per cent), Katihar (45 per cent), Araria (43 per cent) and Purnea (38 per cent), Muslim voters are the deciding factor. This region of Bihar is often called Seemanchal. In about 40 constituencies, the Muslim population is above 25 per cent.The Kushwaha-Koeri-Kurmi combination forms around 12-14 per cent of the total population in Bihar. The problem that Upendra Kushwaha faces is that Nitish Kumar belongs to the same social block and has been able to build an image of ""above caste leader"" who is acceptable to the whole of Bihar.Dalits form another 17-18 per cent of Bihar's population. But the BSP of Mayawati does not have an organisational structure that can challenge Nitish Kumar's social engineering that he has effected over the past 15 years.Nitish Kumar has carved out a separate constituency of Mahadalits -- forming a majority among Dalits -- with special schemes and social welfare programmes.WHAT IS OWAISI AIMING AT?Going by the nature of alliance cobbled up by Owaisi and Kushwaha, it is clear that they aim to confuse the voters in order to break their existing alliances with the Nitish Kumar-led NDA in Bihar and Tejashwi Yadav-led Mahagathbandhan of the RJD-Congress and the Left parties.The biggest aim is to break M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) formula, which has emerged as a result of social engineering experiment by Lalu Prasad during 1990s. Muslims and Yadav (14 per cent) together make up around 32 per cent of all voters in Bihar.It was the winning formula for Lalu Prasad during 15-year RJD rule during which muscleman politician Mohammad Shahabuddin emerged as the Muslim face of the party.That connect was so strong that after he was released from jail when the RJD-JDU-Congress government was in power, Shahabuddin refused to accept Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as his leader in the Mahagathbandhan.The RJD lost its support base among Yadavs, who moved towards the BJP in sizeable numbers across Bihar. Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, drew Muslim voters towards him with his strong secular credentials. Still, M-Y formula is the fallback plan for RJD-led Mahagathbandhan.Owaisi aims to break this caste-community electoral alliance in the long run. This is possibly why he is focusing more on Seemanchal. Of around 50 seats that Owaisi's AIMIM is focusing on, around 30 are with the RJD-led alliance.WHY IS KUSHWAHA AT CENTRE?For the past 30 years, the electoral politics of Bihar has centred around two poles -- Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. Ram Vilas Paswan was another pole but he unsuccessfully attempted to enter Bihar through Delhi.Owaisi has projected Upendra Kushwaha as the chief ministerial candidate of the fledgling alliance. This is an attempt to make Kushwaha a new pole in Bihar politics.The logic is simple. Kushwaha has long been a rival of Nitish Kumar but without achieving the political stature of the Bihar chief minister.Another argument is if 14-percenter (Lalu Prasad) and 4-percenter (Nitish Kumar) rule over Bihar for 30 years, why cannot 6-percenter (Upendra Kushwaha) do the same. The Yadavs form 14 per cent of Bihar's population, Kurmis four per cent and Kushwaha around six per cent.An extension of this logic puts Owaisi in a favourable position to demand a Muslim chief ministerial candidate as the community makes up 17-18 per cent of Bihar's population. Abdul Gafoor was the last Muslim to take oath as Bihar chief minister -- 1973-75.However, the moot question is this: Can Owaisi-Kushwaha's social-election engineering experiment trump Nitish Kumar's time-tested winning formula in Bihar Assembly election?With his principal rival Lalu Prasad, the RJD chief, in jail and passing away of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, Nitish Kumar's strongest opponent appears to be his 15-year-long incumbency.Cashing in on anti-incumbency against Nitish Kumar is a test not only for RJD's chief ministerial aspirant Tejaswhi Yadav and LJP's Chirag Paswan but also for Owaisi and Kushwaha.",2020-10-13

80,Vivek Agnihotri says sue B'wood for destroying art. Nikhil Dwivedi retorts,"Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri has a question for one and all. He asked if the public can sue Bollywood for destroying art, Indian culture and the social fabric of our country on Twitter, last evening (October 12) after news of four Bollywood industry associations and 34 producers suing two news channels and their anchors broke on social media. Producer Nikhil Dwivedi had a cheeky response to Vivek Agnihotri's question. Nikhil simply reminded Vivek that they made the film Hate Story together. And with that, Nikhil rest his case.""Can the public sue Bollywood for destroying music, lyrics, language, art, creativity, social fabric and culture of India? (sic)"" Vivek Agnihotri asked on Twitter. And Nikhil replied, ""Sirrrrrrr You and I made #HateStory together. Bahut trolling hogi hamari shant ho jaao (sic).""Sirrrrrrr You and I made #HateStory together. Bahut trolling hogi hamari shant ho jaao. https://t.co/ePtGyAcugTSO, WHAT ABOUT HATE STORY?For those who are not aware of the phenomenon called Hate Story, which is now a franchise, well, you deserve a pat on the back. However, allow us to scar you. Hate Story, released in 2012, was an erotic thriller film. The first instalment was directed by Vivek Agnihotri and starred Nikhil Dwivedi, Gulshan Devaiah, Paoli Dam, among others. The film wasn't a huge box-office success, however, the makers soon identified that there's a market for the Hate Stories of the world and it was turned into a franchise.So, since then, we've had Hate Story 2 (2014), Hate Story 3 (2015) and the very recent Hate Story 4 (2018). Of these, perhaps the most successful one was Hate Story 3, starring Karan Singh Grover, Sharman Joshi, Zareen Khan and Daisy Shah. Hate Story 4, the latest one, that saw Karan Wahi and Urvashi Rautela, was also pretty successful. Which possibly hints at a Hate Story 5, 6, 7...Though Vivek Agnihotri did not direct any of the latter Hate Stories, and neither was Nikhil Dwivedi seen in them, Nikhil clearly understands that those who're behind Bollywood films like Hate Story shouldn't be commenting on Bollywood's role in ""destroying"" the ""culture of India"" and the ""social fabric"".Vivek's wrath falls on Bollywood after four Bollywood industry associations and 34 producers including Ajay Devgn, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Farhan Akhtar, filed a suit against two news channels and their anchors for making derogatory and defamatory remarks against Bollywood. The suit asks the news channels to abide by the provisions of the Programme Code and to withdraw, recall and take down all the defamatory content published by them against Bollywood.ALSO READ | Bollywood unites to sue 2 news channels and their anchorsALSO READ | Rhea Chakraborty to sue rumour mongers and media for defamationALSO WATCH | Rhea Chakraborty mulls filïng defamation suit against 'rumour mongers'",2020-10-13

What was the need for TDP leaders to claim that Amaravati was being denied its rightful place when all the regions were being given equal prominence by the Jagan government, asked Sajjala.He added, unnecessary hype was being created by the TDP over the three-capital issue.Sajjala challenged the TDP leaders to go to the Centre to seek a CBI inquiry if they have any grouse against the state government.It was just the stooges of opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu who had devoured the lands of the local farmers in the name of insider trading and majority of people who took to streets seem to be pompous landlords, said the top YSRCP government official and termed the protest a drama.On Monday, Nara Lokesh, who is the son of TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, along with Guntur MP Galla Jaidev and other party leaders visited and addressed agitators at Yerrabalem, Krishnayapalem and other villages in the Amaravati capital area.",2020-10-13

However, the overall homebuyer sentiment in 2020 remains weak.Property consultant Anarock said homes worth approximately Rs 88,730 crore were sold in seven top cities in the first three quarters of 2020 in comparison with Rs 1,54,320 crore in the corresponding period in 2019  a 43 per cent decline or a decrease of nearly Rs 65,590 crore.Also Read | Pandemic effect: Housing sales hit, decline almost 52% in top 8 citiesFrom January to September 2020, as many as 87,460 units were sold across the top 7 cities as against approximately 2.02 lakh units sold a year ago.Pandemic dents Delhi-NCR home sales It may be noted that the first three quarters of 2020 have seen much lesser home sales than the corresponding period in 2019.Like the other major cities, the National Capital Region (NCR) recorded a lower number of home sales in the first nine months of 2020 worth Rs 9,430 crore, which is significantly lower than the Rs 24,860 crore in the same period last year and amounts to a 62 per cent drop in home sales.In the NCR region, Gurugram has been hit hardest with a sharp decline in property sales. In the first nine months of 2020, Gurugram registered home sales worth approximately Rs 3,800 crore in comparison to over Rs 10,000 crore for the same period in 2019.Noida, too, has been hit hard due to the lockdown. Homes sales declined to approximately Rs 1,519 crore in comparison to almost Rs 3,899 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Anarock data revealed that overall Q3 2020 homes sales value increased by more than 2.3 times or 134 per cent to Rs 29,731 crore in Q3 from 12,694 in the preceding quarter.Commenting on the report, Anuj Puri, Chairman ANAROCK Property Consultants, said, As was to be expected, the second quarter was lacklustre given the lockdowns and overall pressures on the economy. What is remarkable is how the third quarter stacked up, clearly indicating that buyer sentiment was in place and merely held at bay by uncertainty.Puri went on to say that the upcoming festive season may further provide a boost to home sales in the country.Based on these results, there is now every reason to look at the coming festive season with confidence - homebuyers are back on the market. This return of sentiment, coupled with various festive offers and with attractive financial schemes, will produce a marked uptick, he said.The Anarock report predicts home sales values to go up in the upcoming festive quarter (October  December 2020) due to increased demand fuelled by financial schemes and offers.Also Read | Festival bonanza for central govt employees: Rs 10,000 advance to all, LTC cash voucher",2020-10-13
91,Not doing a favour: SC lashes out at Delhi brothers refusing to pay maintenance to father,"Supreme Court lashed out at two brothers based in Delhi after their father moved a petition in court, alleging they have forced him to move out of his ancestral house and has also refused to give any financial support.According to a report in News18, the Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Khanwilkar said that the sons are not doing a favour on their father and it is their duty by law to provide for him.The court was informed by the fathers side that both the sons work in multi-national companies and have also taken over the ancestral property in Karol Bagh where they live with their families.The Supreme Court bench reminded the sons, Dont forget that you are everything because of him.The father told Supreme Court that not only were the sons earning from their jobs, they also earned a rent from the Karol Bagh ancestral property.Looking at the rent aspect, the court asked the brothers, How can you two now enjoy it without giving him his monetary share at least? The court also pointed out that it was because of the father that the two sons had this property in the first place.Last year, a tribunal court had ordered the two sons to pay Rs 7,000 as maintenance to their father. However, they challenged the order citing provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.The high court then admitted the petition and stayed the tribunal courts order to pay maintenance. This forced the father to move Supreme Court.The top court has also observed that Rs 7,000 is not a decent amount for survival in todays times and the fathers lawyer has appealed for Rs 10,000 in maintenance. The sons have now been asked to reply within a week.",2020-10-13

95,IPL 2020: AB de Villiers's 'massive' six against KKR halts Sharjah traffic,"AB de Villiers put on a genius batting masterclass in Sharjah to help Royal Challengers Bangalore register an 82-run win in a lopsided game against Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday.RCB were 94/2 in 12.2 overs when AB de Villiers walked in, and within a couple of minutes, he started treating KKR bowlers with disdain. De Villiers hit 6 sixes and 5 boundaries as he smashed 73 from just 33 balls. Thanks to de Villiers's fireworks, RCB managed 194 in 20 overs, 83 from the last 30 balls on a sluggish wicket.During the innings, AB de Villiers dispatched Kamlesh Nagarkoti for a huge six over midwicket which sailed outside the Sharjah stadium. One of the sixes, however, landed on the busy Sharjah roads and hit a moving car which then deflected and hit another car.It seems, tomorrow there will be a queue in #Sharjah for special car insurance with 'hitting with cricket ball' clause!!#ABDevilliers you beauty....!! #PlayBold@RCBTweets @ABdeVilliers17 #Dream11IPL pic.twitter.com/20QH1qzZL1Speaking about his knock and the duck against Chennai Super Kings that gave him 'sleepless nights', de Villiers said: ""Got a duck in the last game, a terrible feeling. Getting a duck can give batsmen sleepless nights Very happy that I contributed. Surprised myself out there tonight. Knew the wicket was quite tough to bat on. But I thought 145-150 wasn't enough. So I looked to go further, and was surprised to get 194.""Even AB de Villiers' former South Africa teammate Kagiso Rabada, who is representing the Delhi Capitals, couldn't help but take to Twitter.@ABdeVilliers17 you hitting cars now?!The Royal Challengers Bangalore have been in great form in IPL 2020, with five wins and two losses in seven matches.

96,RCB vs KKR: Ben Stokes called for Chahal to be MoM in batsmens game,"Before Monday, October 12, Dinesh Karthiks Kolkata Knight Riders had all the advantage, be it the recent form in IPL 2020 or their head to head record against Royal Challengers Bangalore, over Virat Kohlis team. However, the extraordinary display of cricket by the legendary AB de Villiers and the RCB bowling unit led a massive 82-run victory against the Kolkata Knight Riders.The contributions of the bowlers, needless to say, was as incredible as that of AB de Villiers. Pacer Chris Morris and off-spinner Washington Sundar bagged 2 wickets each, all important dismissals in the game, while legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal got rid of KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik and produced exceptionally economical figures of 12/1 in his completed 4-over spell. Rajasthan Royals all-rounder Ben Stokes took to Twitter and called for Chahal to be Man of the Match as soon as RCB won the game against KKR.In a batters game @yuzi_chahal should get MOM here,incredible figures especially as its in Sharjah: Chahal wrote.In a batters game @yuzi_chahal should get MOM here,incredible figures especially as its in SharjahThe South African batting legend was awarded the Man of the Match title for his exceptional and unbeaten 33-ball 73 while partnering with captain Virat Kohli (33 off 28). AB de Villiers blasted 6 sixes in his innings and, in fact, one six (85 m) was big enough to fly out of the Sharjah Cricket Stadium and into the running traffic in Sharjah. The ball landed on a busy Sharjah road and hit two moving cars (thankfully no the glass was hit) and slowed down the traffic for a while.RCB posted a massive total of 194/2 after an unbeaten 100-run partnership was added by Kohli and de Villiers in just 46 deliveries. In response to the 195 target, KKR crumbled quickly and were packed and sent back leaving the team on 112/9. Even Shubman Gills 25-ball 34 was too weak to do any good for KKR with that asking rate.",2020-10-13

Soon after arriving at the celebration area, the woman is surprised to witness that the ceremony has been organised as per Hindu rituals. She asks her mother-in-law about it, saying, ""Par yeh rasam toh aapke ghar mein nahi hoti hai na? (But this ceremony is not celebrated at your place, isn't it?),"" and is told, ""Bitiya ko khush karne ki rasam toh har ghar mein hoti hai na? (The ceremony to make the daughter happy is held in every house, isn't it?)""Tanishq, in the description for the video, said, ""She is married into a family that loves her like their own child. Only for her, they go out of their way to celebrate an occasion that they usually don't. A beautiful confluence of two different religions, traditions, cultures.""IS THE TANISHQ AD AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE?No, the Tanishq ad has been taken down after trolls censured the brand left, right and centre for the commercial on Twitter.On YouTube, the video has been made private.However several Twitter users shared the advert on their timelines.

113,"Indian travels to US on forged passport, booked on return after 18 years","An Indian man who returned from the United States after 18 years has been booked by the police for allegedly using a forged passport to travel to the US.According to a report in The Times of India, 61-year-old Kirti Kumar Patel has been booked for travelling abroad on a forged passport. Patel, a native of Ahmedabad, has moved court seeking protection from arrest.However, a Delhi court rejected his petition against arrest and said such forgery and malpractices tarnish the image of the country abroad.In 2002, the Gujarat resident travelled to the US using a different persons passport. Upon his return to India recently, it was found that none of his documents corroborated details of his travel to the US.His lawyer has however said that the man has been falsely named in the FIR.According to the report, the 61-year-old returned to India last month and the IGI police station on September 29 registered an FIR against him on charges of forgery, cheating and relevant sections of The Passport Act.The FIR mentions that upon his arrival from Chicago, the passport furnished by Kirti Patel did not show any details of his journey from India to the US. This suggested that Patel cheated the Indian immigration to go abroad.Returning to India after 18 years, now Kirti Kumar Patel faces arrest. His lawyers have maintained that he is unwell owing to serious health conditions and is being falsely accused of forgery.",2020-10-13

As per the latest reports, he has been out on BiPap ventilation. Chatterjee had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on October 6, following which he was admitted to Bellevue Nursing Home in Kolkata. 85-year-old Soumitra Chatterjee has been under the expert care of the private nursing home since then. However, his health conditions have deteriorated considerably.On October 9, Soumitra Chatterjee was moved to the ITU and put on oxygen support after his health worsened. A three-member medical team was set up to monitor the health of the legendary actor as soon as he was admitted to the hospital. This was also done to ensure he was given the utmost care, considering the Padma Bhushan awardee is a patient of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).On October 6, after his Covid-19 report came back positive, Soumitra Chatterjee's daughter Poulami Bose had said, He is stable. He had a fever in the last few days. We wanted to admit him as a precautionary measure since he has multiple comorbidities.Soumitra Chatterjee had resumed shooting a few days ago. He directed Parambrata, another noted Bengali actor, who completed the shooting of Abhiyan under Chatterjee. Jisshu Sengupta, who was recently seen in Sadak 2 in Bollywood, will be seen playing the role of young Soumitra in the film while the veteran actor himself plays his older self.Soumitra Chatterjee is one of the best and biggest actors Kolkata film industry has seen. He has innumerable hits under his belt, namely Ashani Sanket, Ghare Baire, Aranyer Din Ratri, Charulata, Shakha Proshakha, Jhinder Bandi, Saat Pake Bandha, and more. But for Bengali movie lovers, he will always be known as Feluda.

115,Explained: How Nirmala Sitharamans festive bonanza aims to revive demand,"In a bid to boost demand, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has introduced policy tweaks to accelerate consumer spending and capital expenditure. The tweaks would not only free up the capital by front-loading the expenditure but allow easier capital to kickstart the stuck capital projects at the states. The GDP has already contracted by 23.9 per cent in the first quarter, and RBI expects a contraction of 9.8 per cent (year on year) in the quarter ending with September.After stringent lockdown, the country is in process of lifting the restrictions and is still marred with low demand and uncertainty. RBI predicted that this year the economy may shrink by 9.5 per cent. This would mean erosion of Rs 20 lakh crore worth value. Unless the demand picks up, it is almost impossible to attract investments and curtail the erosion.Also Read | Govt offers festive cheer, but is it enough to boost demand?Meanwhile, the bureaucrats in Sitharamans ministry expect that these tweaks will allow a demand boost worth Rs 73,000 crore in the last two quarters of the fiscal year. Of the total demand value expected, Rs 37,000 crore is directed at kickstarting the capital expenditures in states, defence sector, and other infrastructure projects.The states are allowed to take the additional debt amounting to Rs 12,000 crore as interest-free bonds. These funds would be over and above the additional borrowing ceilings given to the states.They are free to use it in new or ongoing capital projects. By the end of October projects, worth Rs 9.6 lakh crore were stuck, and out of this, Rs 1.8 lakh crore worth were added in the first half of the fiscal.Some of the states and the Centre are at loggerheads because of the way GST compensation was accounted, disbursed and IGST devolution happened in the last one year.The issue has aggravated subsequent to the Covid-19 lockdown. The money generated due to the fresh measures may not be sufficient to put an end to the argument between the central and state governments, but may ease the situation a bit more, and has chances to boost demand, accelerate the growth trajectory and shore up the revenues.Sitharamans package comes into play a week before the country enters into the festival season.Also Read | Festival bonanza for central govt employees: Rs 10,000 advance to all, LTC cash voucherThis will be complemented with the bumper Kharif crop which contributes 6 per cent into the GDP. It is expected the free up cash in the rural economy as well. It is expected that transactions worth 12 lakh crore would happen in the agriculture sector alone; between the last week of September to December first week. The FCI alone has the target of procuring the 49.54 million MT of rice at pre-defined MSP of Rs 1,888 per quintal of paddy.LTC Cash Voucher & Festival Advance Meanwhile, among the announcements made by Sitharaman, the show stoppers were two tweaks  the introduction of LTC Cash Voucher scheme and restoration of the special Festival Advance Transfer scheme. There are 48.34 lakh employees, working with the central government and their PSUs.The two schemes combined is expected to put Rs 36,000 crore in their hands. The fine print of the LTC scheme pushes the employees opting for it  to buy goods or services (attracting GST of 12 per cent or more) three times the fare and equivalent to leave encashment. LTC is part of the compensation package of the government employees, where full payment on leave encashment and fare is done by their employers. And they can opt for it once in four years.Moreover, Rs 10,000 interest-free advance loan to be paid up in the 10 instalments  has also been offered. This bracket of consumption alone can shore up GST collection by Rs 6,500 crore besides pushing demand and bringing in the multiplier effect of both demand generation and governments revenues.The bureaucrats at the Finance Ministry explained that the government employees and those who work with the public sector enterprises have escaped the tremors of Covid, their salaries were protected and savings have increased.Now it is their turn to contribute to revive the demand cycle in the country, Sitharaman explained.Both she and her officials, expect this to work and reduce the damage to the economy to a bare minimum.Also Read | LTC Cash Voucher, Festival Advance Transfer: How central govt employees benefit",2020-10-13

117,Immune Trump says he wants to give big fat kiss to all in audience at rally,"US President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail on Monday for the first time since he announced his Covid-19 diagnosis.As Donald Trump arrived at the outdoor rally in Florida without a protective mask, he tossed out masks to thousands of supporters standing shoulder to shoulder, most without protective face coverings, and repeatedly talked about his recovery from the coronavirus.I went through it now. They say I'm immune. I feel so powerful,"" Trump told the crowd. I will kiss everyone in that audience, I will kiss the guys and the beautiful women, I will give you a big fat kiss,"" Trump was quoted as saying Reuters.The rally in Florida indicated that Trump had not reshaped his campaign approach or outlook since contracting the coronavirus, which has infected more than 7.8 million people in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put millions out of work.Trump: It's risky, but you gotta get outHe told supporters that coronavirus safety lockdowns had done great damage to the economy and were too drastic.""It's risky, but you gotta get out,"" Trump told supporters, who chanted: ""We love you.""Critics have faulted Trump for failing to encourage supporters at campaign events, and White House staff, to wear protective masks and abide by social-distancing guidelines.At least 11 close Trump aides have tested positive for the virus.Trump tests negative for Covid-19: White HouseTrump's rally on Monday came hours after the White House said he had tested negative for Covid-19 on consecutive days and was not infectious to others. They were the president's first negative Covid-19 tests announced by the White House since Trump said on October 2 that he contracted the virus.In a memo, Dr Sean Conley did not say when the tests were conducted but that they and other clinical and laboratory data ""indicate a lack of detectable viral replication.""On Sunday, Trump's assertion that he was now immune to the virus, made without evidence, drew a flag from Twitter for violating the social media platform's rules about misleading information related to Covid-19.Scientific research has been inconclusive on how long people who have recovered from Covid-19 have antibodies and are protected from a second infection.(With Reuters inputs)ALSO READ | Johnson & Johnson pauses vaccine trial after unexplained illness in volunteerALSO READ | Donald Trump claims he is coronavirus immune, Twitter says dont misinform people",2020-10-13
118,Earth to get mini moon in November or is it just space junk from 1960s?,"An asteroid, which is on track to be pulled into Earth's orbit, is likely to get stuck in it and become a ""mini moon"" in November 2020. The space object, dubbed as 2020 SO, will then circle the planet for several months before going back its own way.However, Nasa asteroid experts believe that the ""cosmic object"", which is believed to become a ""mini moon"" for Earth in November after being nabbed by Earth's gravity, might actually be just junk from an old rocket from a failed moon-landing mission in the 1960s.After over 50 years, the old rocket is finally making home!""I'm pretty jazzed about this,"" Paul Chodas told The Associated Press. ""It's been a hobby of mine to find one of these and draw such a link, and I've been doing it for decades now.""Paul Chodas speculates that asteroid 2020 SO is actually the Centaur upper rocket stage that successfully propelled Nasa's Surveyor 2 lander to the moon in 1966 before it was discarded.The lander had then crashed into the moon after one of its thrusters failed to ignite on the way there. The rocket swept passed the moon and then into the orbit around the sun -- unusual for an asteroid. The rocket is now coming back home to circle into Earth's orbit like a mini moon before going back its track.The object was first discovered last month in Hawaii. Based on its brightness, the object is estimated to be roughly 26 feet long.The Nasa experts said that while it was being considered an asteroid that would become a mini moon, circling Earth for several months, there were several features that gave it away.First, its near-circular orbit around the sun, which is unusual for an asteroid.The object is also in the same plane as Earth, not tilted above or below, another red flag. Asteroids, on the other hand, are usually zipped by at odd angles.Another fact that it is approaching Earth at 2,400 kph. Asteroids are faster.There likely are dozens of fake asteroids out there, but their motions are too imprecise or jumbled to confirm their artificial identity, Chodas was quoted as saying by AP.""I could be wrong on this. I don't want to appear overly confident,"" Chodas told AP. ""But it's the first time, in my view, that all the pieces fit together with an actual known launch.""",2020-10-13

AB de Villiers smashed a scintillating 73 not out to steer Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a convincing 82-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Sharjah on Monday.""I think at various points of time we had opportunities to create little inroads, but they got away with some of the shots. AB de Villiers showed why he is such a good player, he made it look easier than it really was, to come out there and score 80 odd runs in the final five overs was not easy,"" Dinesh Karthik said in the post-match press conference.IPL 2020, RCB vs KKR: Report | HighlightsOn winning the toss, RCB first posted 194 for two wickets in 20 overs, thanks to Aaron Finch's 47 off 37 balls and Kohli 33 not out off 28 balls, besides de Villiers' knock. They then restricted KKR for 112 for nine wickets in 20 overs to complete a one-sided win at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.""Sometimes he (de Villiers) is a really hard batsman to bowl to because of the way he moves around the crease, it was not easy to bowl against him, in the match against us, he stayed still and he made sure he cleared his left leg and got a lot of balls outside the ground, overall kudos to him for the way he batted,"" he added.English batsman Tom Banton made his debut for Kolkata Knight Riders in their IPL encounter against Royal Challengers Bangalore and was sent in place of Rahul Tripathi to open for KKR.""Once you play Tom Banton, you have to make sure he opens because that's where he's best at. Rahul Tripathi is versatile, he can adapt to any batting position and situation, so we made sure that Banton opens the batting as he does the same role for his international side,"" Karthik opened up on KKR changing their openers once again in IPL 2020.""I think the wicket was a bit slow as Virat had mentioned at the time of the toss. The wicket got a little slower, it was an ideal bat first wicket,"" Karthik added.",2020-10-13
120,BB14 Day 9 Written Updates: Sara Gurpal becomes first contestant to be evicted ,"By now, its no surprise that the Bigg Boss house is a complete mixture of twists and turns. The day nine of the episode brought yet another twist to the show in the form of a surprise eviction. After getting some harsh and much-needed reality check on the weekend by host Salman Khan, all contestants have started forming their strategies to play their strongest game.Day nine of Bigg Boss started in the morning with the contestants waking up to the song Ishq Wala Love. Later, Eijaz Khan is seen asking Nikki Tamboli if he could use the gym to which the latter says that the gym is Hinas territory, not hers.THE FIGHT OVER ESSENTIALSNikki Tamboli who is the first confirmed contestant of the house has been given special authority by Senior, Hina Khan and is made in charge of the BB mall for the day. She will get to decide what clothes and items the contestants can get. However, this doesn't go down well with her peers and it creates a massive rift between them. After that, the argument ensues among the inmates about the items they could take from the BB mall. While Rahul Vaidya and Abhinav Shukla get into a verbal fight over essentials, Sara says she can't keep on using things of other contestants as she doesn't have clothes, make-up. Jasmin sacrifices her three things for Shehzad, Eijaz and Abhinav.The seniors Sidharth Shukla, Hina Khan and Gauahar Khan are seen discussing about how the freshers are dealing the BB mall situation. Later, Sidharth flirts with Gauahar and Hina tells him that he will still not be in her heart.Later, on a lighter note, the contestants have a funny banter when Nikki takes her ex-boyfriends boxers and starts ironing them. Seeing this the contestants can't stop but overlook their differences with Nikki and start cracking jokes about her behavior. Jaan says, the standard of boxers are also going up.Ex-boyfriend ke shorts iron kar rahi hain @nikkitamboli. #BB14 #BiggBoss2020 #BiggBoss14 @BeingSalmanKhan pic.twitter.com/cw1PF7UQhbTHE NOMINATION TASKLater in the day, Bigg Boss gives a nomination task to the freshers where they have to break clay pots of those competitors who they think don't deserve to be in the game and support it with proper reasoning. The contestants will have to put a pot on a scarecrow and attach a picture to it and then break the pot. The contestants give reasons like The other one is not real or their game is not good enough and major argument breaks out..@nikkitamboli ne phoda @DeolShehzad ka matka aur kar diya unko nominate. #BB14 #BiggBoss2020 #BiggBoss14 @BeingSalmanKhan pic.twitter.com/zK2zlussnpJAAN AND EIJAZ LOCK HORNSEijaz Khan and Jaan Kumar Sanu argue over the fact that Eijaz is seen as the joker of the house. This clearly annoys Eijaz, who decide on taking on Jaan for the same. He corners Jaan outside the gym and told him that everyone, including host Salman Khan laughs at him. Later, Eijaz almost pulls Jaan to the ground while he was sweeping the floor. When Jaan asked him to not annoy him, Eijaz says that first he needs to understand that he should not make fun of him. Jaan later agrees that he wont mess with him anymore.Meanwhile, Eijaz and Jasmin Bhasin patch-up by hugging each other after argument during 'weekend kaa vaar 1'. They say that their misunderstanding have now been cleared.At night, 8:15 pm, Jaan, Nikki, and Nishant Malkani talk about Rubina Dilaik and say that she behaves like a teacher. On the other hand, Rubina, Abhinav, Sara Gurpal are seen discussing that Nikki is giving masala despite all her tantrums. Later, after Nikki prompts Jaan, he tells Rubina that they will wash utensils once instead of twice as it takes a lot of their time. For that, Sara Gurpal calls Jaan a 'lota' who can't use his own mind.SARA GURPAL EVICTEDThe episode then shows the 10th day of the Bigg Boss house. In it, we see that Jasmin Bhasin peps up Jaan to play independently in the house, and later the conversation turns into an argument. Later, Hina Khan gives Jasmin a task wherein she has to justify what essentials she would give to a contestant and why. The matter escalates here.Post lunch, on the same day, the process for nominations begin. Each contestant is asked to nominate two people and explain why they did so. However, Nikki Tamboli is immune to the nominations because she had won the earlier task. Among the nominated are Nishant Malkani, Rahul Vaidya, Shehzad Deol, Jaan Kumar Sanu, Sara Gurpal, Eijaz Khan and Abhinav Shukla. After the votes from freshers are completed, Bigg Boss gives seniors the responsibility to evict one contestant from the game this season. He asks them who would they want to evict. The shortlisted Sara, Nishant and Rahul are seen having a long discussion over who deserves to go out. Meanwhile, the seniors discuss who should be sent back home. While Sidharth says that he finds Sara Gurpal fake, Gauahar Khan and Hina Khan are confused between between Nishant Malkani and Rahul Vaidya. Hina and Gauahar wanted to give Sara the benefit of doubt as she has not been keeping well lately, but Sidharth seemed to be firm in his resolve.Seniors finally decide to evict Sara out of the house, who got emotional and could not stop her tears. Jasmin and Rubina were inconsolable. The other contestants give her a warm sendoff. Some even pointed fingers at Jaan because he was the only one who had voted for her.Udaas @SGurpal ko console kar rahi hain @RubiDilaik. #BB14 #BiggBoss2020 #BiggBoss14 @BeingSalmanKhan pic.twitter.com/UIJY8MONWHPAVITRA AND EIJAZ GET COZYNot long after Saras eviction, Pavitra Punia and Eijaz Khan were seen getting cosy. When Eijaz had gone to the kitchen to get water, Pavitra hopped on his back, rubbed on his ear lobes, gave him kisses and asked him how old he was and why he hadnt gotten married.ALSO READ I Salman Khan reacts to TRP scam on Bigg Boss 14: Sachcha game kheloALSO READ I Bigg Boss 14: Hina Khan shares memories of her notorious chidhood with Sidharth ShuklaALSO READ I Bigg Boss 14: Eijaz Khan discusses his past with Sidharth Shukla, Salman Khan has some advice for him",2020-10-13

123,"Govt offers festive cheer, but is it enough to boost demand?","Ahead of the upcoming festive season, the central government has introduced two measures aimed at boosting the spending power of central government employees. It has also extended the provision to organised sector salaried employees and states.The government has told central employees that the leave travel concession (LTC) allowance could be used to make purchases as Covid-19 protocols prohibit travel at the moment. It also announced a one-time revival of the special festival advance transfer for central government employees.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced the governments plan to grant an interest-free loan payable over 50 years for states. The move is aimed at boosting capital expenditure.Also Read | Festival bonanza for central govt employees: Rs 10,000 advance to all, LTC cash voucherThe message behind the announcements is clear. At a time when the economy is facing headwinds and demand is down, the govt wants to empower consumers so they can go out and spend money, rather than saving it.It may be noted that the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns virtually killed demand in the economy due to two main reasons. 1) It restricted items on which consumers could spend money 2) It led to job losses and salary cuts, thus reducing the spending power of the end customer.The governments announced measures are likely to incentivise a large pool of central government employees, allowing them to spend more. It could turn out to be a significant move in addressing the demand crisis.LTC Cash Voucher schemeThe first of the two consumer-centric stimulus targets lakhs of the central government, private sector and state government employees by allowing them to encash their Leave Travel Concession (LTC) facility for spending on consumer items.Under the current LTC policy, employees working in central or state governments and many players in the private sector are eligible for the concession in a block of four years (one trip to travel any destination in India and one trip to the home town, or two trips to the home town).The fare cost incurred for the travel is reimbursed as per the grades. This amount involved does not invite any tax. The other component in LTC is leave encashment up to 10 days; this is taxable.Sitharaman said that since employees cannot travel due to Covid-19 restrictions the optional scheme will allow employees to spend three times the fare and one-time of leave encashment to avail the benefit of the LTC voucher scheme.But there are riders to the scheme. An employee needs to spend the amount on goods that attract 12 per cent GST. The payment for the purchase has to be made digitally and GST invoice needs to be presented. The seller, therefore, needs to be a GST registered facility.There is a time limit to the offer. Sitharaman said it has to be availed before Mach 31, 2021. In addition, the employee opting for the offer will get tax benefit on the fare only, not the leave encashment.Finance Secretary Ajay B Pandey replying to a query said, The tax benefit on the fare component of LTC will be limited to one-time fare.Simply put, to get a tax benefit of Rs 100, an employee would have to spend Rs 300.Speaking about the cost of the scheme Sitaraman said, If the central government, public undertakings and public bank employees say allow the scheme, nearly Rs 7,575 crore will be the impact.To trigger a demand among employees of state governments, the minister said they can replicate the scheme.Special Festive Advance scheme The govt has also allowed the one-time revival of the Special Festival Advance Transfer scheme for central government employees. The scheme existed before the 7th Pay Commission reward was announced.Central government employees would be eligible for an interest-free advance of Rs 10,000. But this will not be in form of drawable cash; the amount will be pre-loaded in a RuPay card which can be used to make purchases before March 31 thus covering Dussehra Diwali, Eid and Christmas.Also Read | LTC Cash Voucher, Festival Advance Transfer: How central govt employees benefitThe advance will be recovered in 10 equal instalments. Employees dont have to spend it all.The unspent amount will lapse after March 31 and they would be asked to repay only the amount spent.Will the schemes boost demand? The fine print shows the government has not really stretched its purse strings and wants people to lighten their pockets more.Devendra Pant, an economist at India Ratings and Research, said, This is going to have a limited impact.What it is going to do is prepone the demand. There will be no additional demand. However, these measures if they improve the sentiments which are down right now, then demand can improve.Experts are of the opinion that the tweaked LTC scheme may not have a staggering impact due to the rider of a higher spend than eligibility.For instance, if an individual has an entitlement of Rs 40,000 as LTC, the tax liability in case of no claim is Rs 12,000.But the scheme says that an employee has to spend Rs 1.2 lakh to save this tax. They also argue that the current 4-year block of LTC is open till December 2021 so employees may wait beyond March next year and avail of the travel allowance.However, the finance minister said that the total benefit of the two schemes could create Rs 36,000 crore worth of demand.Capex push for states The government also made an announcement that can help cash-strapped states increase consumption and demand. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman announced special interest-free 50-year loans to states for an expenditure of Rs 12,000 crore.Of this, Rs 2,500 crore is carved out for the North Eastern States and hill states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Rest Rs 7,500 crore is earmarked for other states.She said, Rs 2,000 crore will be given to states which manage to complete three out of four reforms as announced under Atmanirbhar Bharat.The USP of the offer is that states will have their share of the loan over and above their existing borrowing limits.While experts say that even this measure may not provide a meaningful boost to capital expenditure, govt feels it may allow accelerated settlement of pending dues of contractors and suppliers.Nirmala Sitaraman said, ""States can use this for ongoing and future projects. Current contractors and suppliers can be paid off.The Centre has also decided to allocate Rs 25,000 crore over and above the capital expenditure of Rs 4.13 lakh crore. It can be spent on projects like road construction, defence, water supply and urban development.The Centres assessment is that these moves could trigger a spike in demand totalling Rs 37,000 crore.Economists and state government officials feel that the schemes launched have a novel spin but the financial cost and impact on economic activity may be nothing more than fairly modest.The announcement of the fresh measures has again pitted the government and opposition parties against each other, similar to the friction witnessed after the Centre had launched the first stimulus under the Aatmanirbhar package.While the central govt feels the measures are substantive, detractors say the schemes are cosmetic.Congresss Gaurav Vallabh said, Finally the government has realised that there is a crisis as far as demand is concerned. But this is mere window dressing. Where is the additional cash to spur demand ?Also Read | Indias economic recovery unlikely this year as pandemic rages on",2020-10-13

125,AB de Villiers surpasses Chris Gayle with 22nd man-of-the-match award in IPL,"Royal Challengers Bangalore star batsman AB de Villiers added yet another feather to his already decorated cap by winning the 22nd Man of the Match award of his IPL career on Monday.AB de Villiers won his 22nd man-of-the-match award in the Indian Premier League after his unbeaten 73 off 33 balls scripted an 82-run win for Royal Challengers Bangalores at Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday. The former South Africa skipper proved yet another time why he is one of the most, if not the most dangerous strikers of the ball.AB de Villiers has now broken Kings XI Punjab opener Chris Gayle's record for most man-of-the-match awards by any player in the history of IPL. AB de Villiers came up with a masterclass of big-hitting on a sluggish wicket as he smashed KKR bowlers around the park before finishing his stunning knock of 73* with 6 sixes and 5 boundaries.Most Man of the Match Awards in IPL history:-AB de Villiers: 22Chris Gayle: 21Rohit Sharma: 18David Warner: 17MS Dhoni: 17Shane Watson: 16IPL 2020, RCB vs KKR: Report | HighlightsAB De Villiers along with RCB skipper Virat Kohli scripted history with their 10th 100-run stand, the most by any batting pair in the IPL. RCB were 94/2 in 12.2 overs when AB de Villiers walked in, and within a couple of minutes, the two batsmen had stitched together a 100-run partnership off 46 balls to take the game away from KKR.Speaking about his knock and the duck against Chennai Super Kings that gave him 'sleepless nights', de Villiers said: ""Got a duck in the last game, a terrible feeling. Getting a duck can give batsmen sleepless nights Very happy that I contributed. Surprised myself out there tonight. Knew the wicket was quite tough to bat on. But I thought 145-150 wasn't enough. So I looked to go further, and was surprised to get 194.""RCB registered a massive 82-run win on the back of de Villiers' batting pyrotechnics and the guile of the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal (1/12) and Washington Sundar (2/20) who were instrumental in stifling KKR to 112 for 9 while chasing a target of 195.",2020-10-13
126,"Coronavirus vaccine: J&J pauses vaccine trials, Pfizer to include younger participants","US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson has paused clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine candidate after an unexplained illness in a volunteer. Johnson & Johnson is conducting Phase III trials of its coronavirus vaccine candidate.In a statement issued late on Monday night, Johnson & Johnson has said, We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our Covid-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.The company has further said, Following our guidelines, the participants illness is being reviewed and evaluated by the ENSEMBLE independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as well as our internal clinical and safety physicians.JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE RESEARCHLast month, J&J had said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine had produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, following which the pharma giant kicked off a final 60,000-person clinical trial. Results of the coronavirus vaccine trial are expected by the end of this year or early 2021.Johnson & Johnson has however refused to divulge further details about the illness in the volunteer and said, We must respect this participants privacy. Were also learning more about this participants illness, and its important to have all the facts before we share additional information.The company has also said that such illnesses in vaccine trial volunteers are a usual phenomenon. Johnson & Johnson has said in its statement, Adverse events illnesses, accidents, etc. - even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.Johnson & Johnson has further clarified that a pause in vaccine trial is however not similar to a ""regulatory hold"" and that such pauses are a common part of clinical trials.ASTRAZENECA VACCINE TRIALSIn September, the coronavirus vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University had suffered a similar setback as Johnson & Johnson which forced the British drugmaker to pause its clinical trials.A volunteer for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in UK had developed an unexplained illness, following which the trials were paused in the country and also in India. However, it has again resumed the trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate across several countries.In a statement, AstraZeneca has now said, Clinical trials for the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, have resumed in the UK following confirmation by the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to do so.The UK committee has concluded its investigations and recommended to the MHRA that trials in the UK are safe to resume, said the statement issued on Monday.The UK government has said Thailand will also be manufacturing the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. India's Serum Institute of India (SII) has already been roped in to make the coronavirus vaccine on a large-scale. SII is also conducting clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine in India.Meanwhile, the US government has awarded $486 million to AstraZeneca to develop and secure supplies of up to 100,000 doses of Covid-19 antibody treatment.The agreement, under the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, is for developing a monoclonal antibody cocktail that can prevent Covid-19, especially in high-risk population like those over 80 years old, the US Department of Health and Human Services said.PFIZER TO INCLUDE YOUNG PARTICIPANTSDrugmaker Pfizer has again modified the protocol for its late-stage study of its vaccine against the new coronavirus, this time to include more young participants.The company said on Monday that it's received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to include adolescents aged 12 through 15 in its global Covid-19 vaccine study.New York-based Pfizer originally planned for 30,000 participants, but in September expanded that to 44,000 people. That increase was made to boost diversity in the trial population, specifically by including 16- and 17-year-old teens, as well as stable patients with some common chronic infections: hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.MEXICO JOINS COVAXMexico government has said it has joined the WHO-led Covax coronavirus vaccine alliance and made a payment of $159.88 million. The country has made the payment in order to gain access to Covid-19 vaccine doses as part of the Covax programme.The Covax Facility is a multilateral initiative running trials on several potential vaccines. The payment made to Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which administers Covax, will allow Mexico to acquire enough doses of a vaccine to immunize up to a fifth of the country's population of around 125 million people.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan has said that more than 180 countries have joined the vaccine alliance led by the organisation.

Around 4.4 million people fall into high alert areas that include Manchester, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire.""We want to create the maximum possible local consensus behind this more severe local action, so in each area we will work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken. This could lead to further restrictions on the hospitality, leisure, entertainment or personal care sectors, but retail, schools and universities will remain open,"" Boris Johnson said.Meanwhile, calling it a wrong decision to single out pubs, Emma McClarkin, Chief Executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, the leading trade association representing brewers and pub said: Public Health England figures released on Friday show hospitality was responsible for just 3% of total transmissions. Where is the merit in closing pubs to combat the virus based on information? Especially when they are providing a safe and regulated place for people to meet at.Referring to the 10 pm curfew, rule of six and limited operating space due to social distancing, Emma McClarkin said, Local lockdowns that close pubs will devastate our sector and the communities it serves. And most pubs will struggle to sustain viable business under tier two with their trade being so heavily impacted. Thousands of local pubs and jobs will be lost for good.British Beer & Pub Association insists that the review of the situation should happen within two weeks instead of a month.Responding to Boris Johnson's announcement about the creation of a three-tier alert system for England, Chair of British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul said:While PM Johnson is absolutely right in saying that we cannot let the virus spread unchecked and we need to have simple rules but we can all understand and support that this three-tier lockdown system is not, in itself, the solution to halting the spread. We need to see a national prevention plan effective national measures, supported by the wider public, to reduce infection rates and avoid the damaging effect of lockdown on local populations and businesses.London is in the medium alert category as of now but this could change very quickly - potentially even this week"", London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.These restrictions apply to England while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus lockdown restrictions.As of Monday, UK reported 13,972 confirmed coronavirus cases and a further 50 people had died with Covid-19, after testing positive within the last 28 days.(With inputs from AP)ALSO READ | After 15 years, BCG vaccines resurface in UK.

De Villiers said being the wicketkeeper has helped him understand things better and bounce off ideas to the bowlers and Virat Kohli in the ongoing season.AB de Villiers did not start as the wicketkeeper for RCB as Virat Kohli's men went with Australian Josh Phillipe in the first 2 matches of IPL 2020. However, to lend additional balance to the side, de Villiers took over the gloveman role and the move has worked wonders for RCB.IPL 2020, RCB vs KKR: Report | HighlightsVirat Kohli's men have been able to play an extra bowler or an extra batsman according to conditions and have looked the most-balanced side in their recent history. De Villiers' experience from behind the stumps is also helping the bowlers, especially their spinners to get things right on conditions that have difficult to master in the UAE.""You have a very good view as a wicketkeeper. I have always enjoyed keeping, taking the gloves. It stopped for a while when I was captain of SA. Now I am taking the gloves back, I am very excited. Really enjoying that,"" AB de Villiers said.""You see things differently from the back. I have got a lot of info that I can use and share with Virat, he doesn't always have to use it. But I do bounce off some ideas from time to time and the bowlers as well.""As a wicketkeeper, you have a very good idea of the pace of the game.""When asked about whether wicketkeeping is taking a toll on his body, de Villiers said: ""Different skills completely (fielding and wicketkeeping). I have had days where I have felt drained out after fielding. It depends. I worked really hard with the gloves leading up to this (IPL) to make sure I am up to the standards. I haven't had a lot of opportunities for stumping or catches. I want to be the best there is, that's always been my attitude.""It was not de Villiers's glovework that dominated the headlines on Monday as he hit a 33-ball 73 not out on a sluggish Sharjah wicket. The South African star was in imperious hitting form as he smashed 6 sixes and 5 boundaries on a pitch where every other batter struggled to get going.Speaking about his knock and the duck against Chennai Super Kings that gave him 'sleepless nights', de Villiers said: ""Got a duck in the last game, a terrible feeling. Getting a duck can give batsmen sleepless nights Very happy that I contributed. Surprised myself out there tonight. Knew the wicket was quite tough to bat on. But I thought 145-150 wasn't enough.

All-round RCB shined in all the departments to completely outshine Dinesh Karthik's side. There were many star performers from RCB but 'Mr 360' AB de Villiers made sure that his captain remembers him vividly.AB de Villiers smashed a fifty off 23 runs and along with Virat Kohli helped RCB collect 95 runs from the final 7 overs. He did not even spare IPL 2020's most expensive bowler Pat Cummins and hit some gigantic sixes off him. Some sixes he hit went out of the stadium into the streets of Sharjah, striking cars and what not.Virat Kohli was having the best seat in the stadium to watch the glittery innings from the South African star. Virat Kohli was finding it hard to find a boundary and could score only one on the 25th ball of his 33-run 28 balls unbeaten innings. He was visibly astonished and delighted at some of the shots by de Villiers and his expressions came out in abundance during the post-match presentation ceremony. Virat Kohli called AB de Villiers a ""super-human"", only he could have played an innings like that on a Sharjah wicket which wasn't having its ""usual sheen"".""At the toss the pitch didn't have the usual Sharjah sheen. Knew the wicket was going to get slower and slower. Barring one super-human, everyone struggled on that pitch. Talk was around 165-170. He was unbelievable. I thought I had a few balls under my belt so I'll start striking. But he came in and hit his third ball nicely. On a pitch like that, only AB can do that. It was a special knock. We got 195 purely because of the genius of that man,"" Kohli said.The 31-year-old also heaped rich praises on his bowlers who performed to perfection on a Sharjah wicket which is very often referred as paradise for the batsmen. The pacers gave RCB the momentum as Navdeep Saini struck in the 4th over of the match. The introduction of Washington Sundar in the 6th over was like beginning of the end of KKR stalwarts. Yuzvendra Chahal chipped in and gave joined forces with Sundar to completely dismantle the Kolkata batting-unit. Wickets were raining throughout in the second innings at Sharjah. KKR were restricted to a paltry total of 112/9 at the end of their 20 overs. At the end of the every single RCB bowler had taken a wicket at least.""They've played good cricket in this IPL. Coming here, it was important to get the right start. Great to see individuals step up when the team required. Bowling unit, with Morris coming in, looks all the more potent. Very happy. Preparation was really good. Three week camp helped us. Have clarity of plans. Know exactly what we want to do on the field. All depends on the mindset. It's very positive. If your bowling unit is strong, you have a great chance of going deep in the tournament. Always things you can reflect on and say you can improve on these things. All about taking this momentum forward. Don't want to be complacent,"" Virat Kohli asserted.With 10 points from 7 matches, RCB are sitting on the 3rd position in 8-team IPL 2020 points table. They will be facing Kings XI Punjab on Thursday.",2020-10-13

Any country that seeks a free and open Indo-Pacific and is willing to take steps to ensure that should be welcome to work with us.This comes just days after the ministerial level Quadrilateral Security Dialogue was held in Tokyo among foreign ministers of Australia, India, Japan and the United States of America.Together we stand for a pluralistic vision that will ensure that our countries, and all the regions diverse countries, can thrive as sovereign and prosperous nations in a free and open Indo-Pacific. One might call this a vision of a Pax Indo-Pacifica, a region at peace, protected and made prosperous in equal measure by those who comprise the Indo-Pacific, Stephen Biegun added.The emphasis of all these nations has been the changing times and the reality of a new global post-WWII alliance structure that can sustain the free and open order, our strategic relationships need to reflect the geopolitical realities of today and tomorrow. Much has changed over the past seventy years, and our own thinking must evolve as well, the US deputy secretary of state said.Biegun added, As the United States assesses our own interests and how they intersect with Indias, we have seen the conditions emerge for an organic and deeper partnershipnot an alliance on the postwar model, but a fundamental alignment along shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests and shared values.Highlighting the issue of the big elephant in the room: China, the US deputy secretary of state said that countries have been overtly cautious about Beijings concerns over fully fleshing out the Quad grouping and allow other like-minded nations to join in.We have been too cautious. Last weeks important and successful Quad ministerial leaves the United States confident that perhaps, just maybe, we can say that we are present at the creation of those strategic linkages, he said.Biegun also asserted that there is a need for Quad nations to stay engaged at all levels and regularise contact between the Quads diplomats, defense officials, and technical experts. As one example, early in March Foreign Secretary Shringla and I began weekly calls with Quad partners and other Indo-Pacific counterparts to discuss how we could coordinate efforts to combat the pandemic and plan for our collective recovery, he said.These relationships should go beyond government-to-government contact to span all areas of mutualeconomics, development, trade, investment, health, technology and innovation, as well as security cooperation, he added.The development of the Indo-Pacific energy and infrastructure through the next decade would amount to nearly $25 trillion in capital. Only cooperation and expansion can sustain such an important strategic project according to Biegun.In Southeast Asia, Quad partners can deepen engagement with ASEAN, cooperate in defending the freedom of the seas, and work together in governance, health, environmental protection, water conservation and transparent data sharing, especially regarding the Mekong, he said.He will be holding important foreign office consultations and meetings before heading to Dhaka which is his second leg of the two-country tour.",2020-10-12

144,IPL 2020: AB de Villiers and spinners lead RCB rout of KKR in Sharjah,"It was Virat Kohli the other night against Chennai Super Kings in Dubai and on Monday, it was AB de Villiers single-handedly knocking the wind out of Kolkata Knight Riders as Royal Challengers Bangalore clinched their 2nd win as three days as their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 campaign is picking pace at the right time.With 5 wins from 7 matches, Royal Challengers Bangalore are tied on points with table-toppers Mumbai Indians. Virat Kohli's men are at the 2nd spot on IPL 2020 points table due to the former's superior Net Run Rate.AB de Villiers's genius gave Royal Challengers Bangalore 194 in 20 overs and the cushion to attack without minding the size of the boundaries. RCB did not put a foot wrong on Monday as their fast bowlers struck early, their spinners came up with a bowling display that is worthy of being a blueprint for how to bowl in Sharjah against some of the cleanest hitters of the ball.They took their catches alright and were electric on the field, imbibing their captain's energy as RCB clinched an 82-run win. KKR were restricted to 112 for 9 -- their lowest total against RCB in the history of IPL.Pacer Navdeep Saini gave the early breakthrough by removing young England batsman Tom Banton who was a little tentative on his IPL debut as early as the 4th over. Then came Washington Sundar who joled Kolkata Knight Riders with two big wickets, removing their enforcers in Nitish Rana (9) and Eoin Morgan (1).IPL 2020 Ful CoverageYuzvendra Chahal got the big wicket of in-form Dinesh Karthik for 1. Virat Kohli was brilliant with his captaincy as he brought both the spinners in tandem, challenging the KKR batsmen to go after them. Sundar and Chahal did not give anything away as they conceded just 32 runs in 8 overs and picked up 3 crucial wickets between them.Even for Andre Russell, the asking rate was too steep but the big-hitter, who had recovered from an injury scare, threatened to come up with another of those single-handed miracles but Isuru Udana, who gave away 14 runs in 3 balls, got the big wicket, ending Russell's stay for just 16. Udana was brilliant on the field as well as he ran out Shubman Gill for 34 just when the youngster was looking to go big.Earlier in the day, AB de Villiers came up with a masterclass of big-hitting on a sluggish wicket where even Virat Kohli struggled to get boundaries frequently. In fact, the RCB skipper managed his first boundary only in the 25th ball he faced but de Villiers finished his stunning knock with 6 sixes and 5 boundaries.It was Aaron Finch and Devdutt Padikkal who gave RCB a strong start with some fine power-hitting in the powerplay. However, once the ball got a bit older, the two batsmen slowed down and lost their wickets. There was a period of 4 overs after Padikkal's exit when RCB did not manage a single boundary.However, after de Villiers walked in, it was just one-way traffic. The legendary batsman proved yet another time why he is one of the most, if not the most dangerous strikers of the ball.",2020-10-12

147,"Delhi's records worst air quality since February as farm fires continue in Punjab, Haryana","Delhi on Monday recorded its worst air quality since February as the concentration of fine particulate matters PM2.5 and PM10 increased to their highest recorded levels this season.The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, Safar, however, said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 261. It was 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.The AQI hit the ""very poor"" levels at Delhi Technological University (307), ITO (315), Patparganj (307), Ashok Vihar (302), Jahangirpuri (320), Vivek Vihar (351), Wazirpur (306), Bawana (310) and Anand Vihar (312), news agency PTI reported.The last time Delhi's air quality hit such poor levels was on February 26 (AQI 274).An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.A senior scientist at the Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.""Stubble burning has also increased in neighbouring states. A change in wind direction is likely to improve AQI slightly on Tuesday,"" he said.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 258 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) at 7 pm -- the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 - finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream - were 119 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.Delhi's air quality had turned poor on Wednesday, the first time in since June 29, with the Central Pollution Control Board recording a 24-hour average AQI of 215.Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) said the AQI is predicted to improve slightly -- to the moderate category -- by Wednesday, October 14.Meanwhile, as many as 614 farm fires were observed in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions on Sunday but ""the count is nearly one eight the peak values recorded in the last two years"", it said.Farm fires contributed 3 per cent particulate matter to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration on Monday. It is likely to be ""negligible"" for the next two days due to a change in the wind direction from northwesterly to southeasterly, the government agency said.On Monday, Delhi's minimum temperature was recorded at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 4 kilometres per hour.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in the accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.What is more concerning is that experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic.High levels of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent -- to Delhi's air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign -- ""Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh' -- which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A ""green war room"" with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government will also start the spraying of ""Pusa bio-decomposer"" solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.'Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.(With inputs from PTI)",2020-10-12
148,IPL 2020: AB de Villiers equals Kieron Pollards record for quickfire fifties,"Need quick fifties? Call AB de Villiers. The Royal Challengers Bangalore batsman was in imperious hitting form on Monday against Kolkata Knight Riders in Sharjah in their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 meeting. On a sluggish wicket where boundary-hitting wasn't easy, de Villiers sent it flying across all parts of the park and outside it as well.AB de Villiers walked into the middle when KKR had slowed things down with wickets of Aaron Finch and Devdutt Padikkal after the powerplay overs. However, the South African star was in the mood from the word go as he hit 6 sixes and 5 boundaries and finished with 73 not out from just 33 balls.RCB vs KKR live updates: IPL 2020De Villiers got to his fifty in just 23 balls, thereby equalling Mumbai Indians' all-rounder Kieron Pollard's record for the most number of fifties hit in 23 or fewer balls in the IPL. Both the batsmen now have 6 fifties which have come in 23 or fewer balls.There is no surprise that some of the cleanest strikers of the ball in the elite list as Virender Sehwag is at the 3rd spot with 5 such quickfire fifties. Yusuf Pathan, David Warner and Chris Gayle have 4 each.This was also AB de Villiers' 36th fifty in the IPL. During the big-hitting blitz, AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli also completed 3000 runs together in the T20 league. While de Villiers was hitting them to the streets of Sharjah at alarming regularity, Kohi was struggling to get the boundaries.When he finally got one in the 25th ball he faced in the innings, Kohli celebrated it by punching the air. RCB, at one stage, looked like they needed to go big to even get to 170. However, de Villiers's spectacular knock gave them 194 on the board.",2020-10-12
149,IPL 2020: KKR all-rounder Andre Russell takes 300 T20 wickets,"Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Andre Russell on Monday scalped his 300th T20 wicket when he dismissed the Royal Challengers Bangalore opener Devdutt Padikkal.Russell became the 10th player to achieve this feat in his 337th T20 appearance. His Caribbean team-mate Dwayne Bravo tops the list with 509 wickets, way above anyone else. The second in the list is the Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga with 390 wickets.Others in between are Sunil Narine (390), Imran Tahir (380), Sohail Tanvir (362), Shakib-Al-Hasan (354), Shahid Afridi (339), Rashid Khan (317) and Wahab Riaz (304).Tiiiimbbeeerrrrr!Russell gets his 300th wicket, dismissing Padikkal!RCB 67/1 (7.4)#KKRHaiTaiyaar #Dream11IPL #RCBvKKR pic.twitter.com/v2U9pUsJXLWith the dismissal, he also became the second cricketer in the world to score 5000 T20 runs and take 300 wickets after Dwayne Bravo. The latter has scored 6331 runs in his career, while Russell has managed 5642 runs.On Monday in Sharjah, the Royal Challengers Bangalore were off to a flyer after winning the toss. Russell, however, provided the much-needed break when he dismissed Padikkal for 32 in the 8th over of the game. Padikkal, who scored 32 runs off 23 balls with 4 fours and 1 six in his innings, was bowled by Russell.But after that, the Caribbean player was hit all around the Sharjah stadium by RCB batsman AB de Villiers and finally finished with the bowling figures 4-0-51-1.An AB de Villiers masterpiece took the RCB to 194/2 in 20 overs. The South African smashed an unbeaten 73 off 33 balls with 5 fours and 6 sixes.",2020-10-12
150,Should have got out earlier: Finch in awe of de Villiers masterclass in Sharjah,"Royal Challengers Bangalore opener Aaron Finch joked about batting longer during their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 outing against Kolkata Knight Riders after seeing AB de Villiers go hammer and tongs towards the end of their innings in Sharjah on Monday.Aaron Finch who was looking to find form got off to a fine start, putting pressure on the KKR bowlers but he slowed down after the powerplay as the Sharjah pitch slowed down considerably as well as the ball got a bit older. Finch eventually departed for 47 from 37 balls.IPL 2020, RCB vs KKR live udpatesFinch's departure brought AB de Villiers into the middle and the equation changed completely. AB de Villiers was in the mood to hit some big sixes right from the word go. He made batting look easy on a wicket where even his partner Virat Kohli was struggling to get the timing right.Kolkata Knight Riders had done well to put the brakes on RCB's scoring rate after the wickets of openers Finch and Devdutt Padikkal who had put on 67 for the 1st-wicket stand. However, de Villiers came up with one of the most memorable big-hitting knocks of IPL 2020.De Villiers hit 6 sixes and 5 boundaries as he hit one of the best bowlers of the moden-era, Pat Cummins, to the cleaners. He continued treating KKR bowlers with disdain as he hit 73 from just 33 balls. Thanks to de Villiers's fireworks, RCB managed 194 in 20 overs, 83 from the last 30 balls on a sluggish wicket.""As the ball softened, the sheen went off and it became a bit tougher, they bowled the cutters and the slower balls during the middle phase of the innings, it became tough to hit. He (AB de Villiers) is a special batsman, when a guy can hit it all around the park like that without even doing anything - his sheer presence out there puts the pressure on the opposition, he makes the pitch look easy,"" Finch said.""Perhaps, I should have got out earlier. At one stage, we thought 180 was a good score on this ground, we have 194 which is a competitive total.""When AB de Villiers was going great guns at one end, Virat Kohli was struggling to get boundaries. The man, who had hit 90 from just 52 balls the other night in Dubai against Chennai Super Kings, hit his first boundary in the 25th ball he faced. After the ball flew off his outside edge, Kohli punched the air in delight. It was an absolutely special innings from Mr. 360 who was at it again!",2020-10-12
151,Turban row: Manjinder Sirsa files complaint against Kolkata Police over assault on Sikh man,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa has filed a complaint against Kolkata Police officers over an incident on October 8 when a scuffle between the West Bengal Police and a Sikh bodyguard of a BJP protestor in Kolkata broke out.In a video of the incident, cops can be seen manhandling the Sikh man, identified as Balwinder Singh, during which the latter's turban falls off.Although the West Bengal Police issued a statement clarifying its personnel did not pull off the turban and it fell off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, the BJP has accused Kolkata Police and the West Bengal government led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of insulting the Sikhs.The police said the person in question was carrying firearms during the protest and its attempt to recover the same led to the scuffle and the 'accident' with the turban.""I have filed a police complaint in Howrah police station for registration of FIR u/s 295A against Kolkata Police officers who behaved barbarically with Balwinder Singh I hope the DGP @WBPolice will take action on my complaint and ensure justice,"" SAD leader and Manjinder Singh Sirsa tweeted.I have filed a police complaint in Howrah police station for registration of FIR u/s 295A against Kolkata Police officers who behaved barbarically with Balwinder SinghI hope the DGP @WBPolice will take action on my complaint and ensure justice pic.twitter.com/mfp0v9UfliMeanwhile, the National Commission for Minorities took note of Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga's letter to Commission member Atif Rasheed, demanding ""strictest possible"" action in the matter.In a tweet, Rasheed said, ""As a member of Minorities Commission I have immediately taken cognizance of your complaint and the Commission will take the required action in the matter by tomorrow.""Bagga, in his letter, said, ""What is happening in Bengal is really unforgivable.

This is really unforgettable. I urge you to take action against erring police officers as soon as possible,"" he further said.The BJP, whose protest march to the state secretariat Nabanna on October 8 witnessed clashes with police, has accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led Bengal government of hurting the sentiments of Sikhs.The TMC, on the other hand, had dubbed the allegations as ""baseless"" and accused the BJP of ""trying to communalise the issue"".(With PTI inputs)",2020-10-12
152,"GST Council meet ends with no consensus, Centre says will not borrow for states","The deadlock over compensating states for the shortfall in GST collections continued on Monday with the 42nd meeting of the GST Council ending without reaching any consensus.Addressing the media after the meeting, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the meeting was an extension of the previous meeting and all the states spoke on the issue of borrowing and extension of the compensation cess, and clarifications were sought by the states on specific points.""There was no consensus arrived on a matter on which differences exist. The GST Council can certainly take a call on cess, collection of cess, extending the period of collecting the cess and so on. That was repeatedly reiterated,"" Sitharaman said.However, in a major development, Nirmala Sitharaman indicated that the states which wanted to borrow as per the proposed first option which has largely been opted for, could themselves approach the Centre, which will facilitate such borrowings.There was no unanimity among the members of the GST council on borrowing but if there are states who want to go ahead and borrow, we will facilitate them, she added.The panel, which is the highest decision-making body on indirect taxes, for the second time in a week, failed to reach a consensus on the Centre's proposal of states borrowing against future GST collections to make up for the shortfall.This was the third meeting in a row that discussed compensation shortfall without a decision.The opposition-ruled states have rejected the finance ministry's proposal that the state governments should borrow to meet the shortfall in GST revenue. These states have asked the centre to borrow on their behalf and also demanded the setting up of a dispute settlement mechanism.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who heads the Council, said the Centre cannot borrow and pay states for the shortfall as it would lead to a rise in bond yields, resulting in the rise in borrowing costs for the government and the private sector.""Centre has issued a borrowing calendar, if I go beyond that to borrow, the G-Sec deals which are used as a benchmark for every other borrowing will go up. This will increase borrowing costs for states & private sector too,"" the finance minister also said.However, this would not be the case if states borrowed against future GST receipts, she said, adding 21 states had agreed to borrow as suggested by the Centre.Expressing her displeasure with the states which continued to stand against borrowing, she noted that on the one hand there were states which wanted to get the money as soon as possible to meet their expenditure requirements, while few others kept saying that the decision must be reached on the basis of consensus.She reiterated that the entire interest and principal amount will be paid from cess. The council has already extended the period of cess beyond the five-year transition period that ends in June 2022. ""The entire compensation calculation of the states will be paid. And states will not have to pay from any other resource,"" she said.Nirmala Sitharaman added that while there may be differences among states and the Centre over the issue but there is no dispute.WHAT IS THE GST COMPENSATION ISSUE?The Centre in August gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the RBI or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market and had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury, demerit and sin goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.Following a demand by some states, the amount of Rs 97,000 crore was increased to Rs 1.10 lakh crore.Opposition-ruled states have, however, demanded setting up of a dispute settlement mechanism.As many as 21 states -- which are BJP ruled or have supported it on various issues -- have opted to borrow Rs 1.10 lakh crore to meet the compensation shortfall.In its previous meeting last week, the Council had decided to extend the surcharge on taxes on luxury goods such as cars and tobacco products beyond June 2022 but failed to reach a consensus on ways to compensate states for loss of tax revenue.The projected total compensation shortfall in the current fiscal stands at Rs 2.35 lakh crore.The Centre has released Rs 20,000 crore to the states towards compensation shortfall so far in the current fiscal.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs.On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods, and the proceeds from the same are used to compensate states for any revenue loss.",2020-10-12
153,"After 15 years, BCG vaccines resurface in UK. This time to fight Covid","Scientists in the UK will begin recruiting frontline healthcare workers to test if an old vaccine used to combat tuberculosis (TB), the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or BCG jab, can be repurposed to help boost immunity against the novel coronavirus as well.The University of Exeter in south-west England is leading BRACE trials, research to test the viability of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin {BCG} and tuberculosis {TB} vaccines to fight out Covid till the actual vaccine is available.The BCG and TB vaccines have been used on 100 million babies worldwide including India and are now being tested on frontline healthcare workers in the UK.The BCG vaccine has the ability to stimulate the immune system to fight future infections efficiently and it is this ability that could come handy in battling out Covid-19 while the actual vaccine comes through.The BCG vaccine boosts immunity by training the immune system to respond to other subsequent infections with greater intensity. Researchers hope this improved innate immunity will buy crucial time to develop an effective and safe vaccine against Covid-19.Leading the BRACE study from the University of Exeter, Professor John Campbell said, ""BCG has been shown to boost immunity in a generalised way, which may offer some protection against Covid-19.He added, If it does, we could save lives by administering or topping up this readily available and cost-effective vaccination.In the UK, BCG and TB vaccination started in 1953 but was stopped in 2005 due to the low incidence of the disease.During the BRACE trial, care home workers and healthcare workers in the south-west of England will be given this vaccine.Explaining the rationale behind it, Professor Campbell said, People on the Covid-19 frontline, including healthcare workers and care home workers, are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus infection. Up until now, care home workers have been overlooked by most research. The BRACE trial provides us with a great opportunity to offer potential help to this important group of individuals who are providing healthcare to some of our most vulnerable citizens in important community settings.Exeter General Physician (GP) Sam Hilton said, Being a GP Im going to be coming into contact with patients this winter, and Ill be quite exposed to Covid-19. Theres a real chance that the BCG vaccine could work and could protect me.He added, This is a tried and tested a vaccine thats been used for decades. The risk for me is low - we know its a safe vaccine. I feel comfortable going into this trial without putting myself at risk. Id encourage any health workers or care home workers to sign up too. We know were at higher risk of Covid-19, and by taking part in this trial, we could have a lot to gain and really nothing to lose.The BRACE trial that is initially recruiting 1,000 participants is coordinated by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI) in Melbourne, Australia.The trial has received more than $10M from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to allow its global expansion. The Peter Sowerby Foundation has contributed funding to support the Exeter trial site. Operations Director of Exeter CTU Lynne Quinn said, The first wave of recruitment will take place in and around Exeter, and we have exciting plans to expand to other sites across the UK, so we hope to be expanding our recruitment numbers at a later stage.The trial expects to recruit over 10,000 healthcare staff has Australia, the Netherlands, Spain and Brazil also involved in it.Global Head of BRACE trial, Professor Nigel Curtis, at MCRI in Australia, said: We are delighted that the UK is joining this international trial to help determine if we can repurpose an existing safe vaccine to reduce the impact of Covid-19 in healthcare workers, including those working in care homes who are at particular risk.This comes amidst warning from UK medical experts of a rise in the number of cases and expectation of lockdown measures.Deputy chief medical officer of England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam has revealed that there has been a ""marked pickup"" of Covid-19 cases since early September.As a result, NHS Nightingale hospitals, constructed in the early phase of the pandemic to take away the pressure on the health service are being asked to be on standby in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate.",2020-10-12

155,Indian family in Armenia converts restaurant to free-meal centre for refugees ,"The ongoing military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan has left scores of people homeless from Nagorno-Karabakh region. Many have fled their homes and moved to the capital city of Yerevan.While the nation has come together to help the refugees from the border areas, here is an Indian family living in Armenia for the past six years who are doing their bit for the country they now call their home.Parvez Ali Khan, a 47-year old Indian from Malerkotla in Punjab, has been running a restaurant 'Indian Mehak' for the past six years in Armenia. He lives in Yerevan with his wife and two daughters, who are studying.When he heard of the crisis, he wanted to help the affected people out in any way that he could.Speaking to India Today from Yerevan, he said, ""When war started I saw the entire country come together. Everyone was extending help with food, medicine, supplies. We also offered clothes. But I saw they needed cooked food not food supplies. That's when I thought of delivering cooked food to them.""Owning a restaurant seemed like a great advantage to them but they were short-staffed since most of their workers were sent back to India due to spread of Covid-19 pandemic. That didn't stop this Punjabi family, however.""This time the Indian staff we have is pretty less. Many went back to India because of Covid. Now, because we had put up numbers and so many people reached out for food, so the first few days were difficult because of shortage of staff,"" he said.""Then we sent out messages seeking help from volunteers. Every Armenian wanted to come forward and help. It was heartening to see. We have fifty volunteers who help us in the kitchen and help deliver the food. Many Armenians have joined our cause,"" he said.Fifty volunteers and the Khan family together feed many people in Yerevan. His kitchen opens early in the morning and people take turns to cook, assemble, pack and then organisations, who reached out to them help deliver the food.Well, through social media.After realising that there were people out there who needed cooked meal, Parvez and his daughters put up messages on Facebook. That resulted in many reverting and connecting with them.Aqsa, his daughter, said, ""We put up numbers and people shared it in different groups. People are sharing our numbers with refugees that they come across. They then call us.""""We are also working with a few organisations, which are supporting us. They contact us with list and food requirements. They come and take food and deliver it themselves. We have two days of advance booking but we are trying to increase the quantity being prepared so as to reach out to maximum people,"" Aqsa said.They started the service on October 4. While the first few days were difficult with the family working from 9 am till 9pm, it got easier when volunteers joined in.The family was heartened to see so many Armenians join them. They have also kept the food to the taste of Armenians even if some of the dishes are Indian - such as, puris, naan, chole-bhature, vegetables with potatoes. They give that or sandwiches and rolls. But always make sure that the meals are cooked in less oil and almost no spice to suit their palette.""We cook for children and grown-ups. We are cooking according to their taste. They don't eat spicy food. We are taking care of them. They are also enjoying some Indian food as well,"" said Parvez.For now, Yerevan is safe but the Indian mission there has asked the Indian diaspora to be on alert and shared emergency numbers with them.""Yerevan is safe. There are problems in Karabakh areas. The government is very supportive. Our embassy and ambassador are in touch with the Indians. Emergency numbers have been put up on the Facebook.We feel safe and are not scared,"" he said.",2020-10-12

We are trying to complete requisite formalities to enable their return to India,"" the MEA said.Following the kidnapping, the Indian embassy in Tunisia reached out to the Libyan government authorities as also the international organisations present there, seeking help in rescuing the Indian nationals.The Indian mission in Tunisia handles matters relating to the welfare of Indian nationals in Libya.Libya, an oil-rich country in North Africa, has been witnessing large-scale violence and unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade regime in 2011.In September 2015, an advisory was issued by the government for Indian nationals to avoid travelling to Libya in view of the security situation there.In May 2016, the government imposed a complete travel ban irrespective of the purpose in view of the deteriorating security situation in Libya.(With PTI inputs)ALSO READ | Kushinagar man, 6 other Indians abducted in Libya: UP residentALSO READ | 18 Indians kidnapped by pirates near Nigerian coast released",2020-10-12
159,Metro car shed project: Maharashtra government starts soil testing at Kanjurmarg,"Within 24 hours of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announcing the relocation of Metro car shed project from Aarey to Kanjurmarg, the work on testing the soil for feasibility has started on ground zero.The proposed stretch of land is located right next to the Eastern Express Highway. Experts say once the soil testing work is done, the drawing stage will start and it would not take more than two-three months for the project to start.On Monday, activist D Stalin of Vanshakti NGO told India Today, The soil testing work for the Metro car shed has commenced at Kanjurmarg. I have personally visited and witnessed the activities. It was clearly confirmed that MMRDA had directed this work.Ever since the big decision by the chief minister, the question that is being asked by one and all is whether Kanjurmarg was recommended by the expert panel initially or not, and if that was the case, why was it not accepted by the government? Senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has written a clarification letter on the same, and maintains that it is not feasible to change the location.MMRC and state government had accepted the Kanjurmarg land on the recommendation of the expert committee in 2015 itself. However, the said land had been claimed by private landowners and in a long pending litigation there had been a status quo order against the state government issued by the Bombay High Court since 1997, said Somaiya. He added that the status quo could not be vacated despite best efforts by the government and MMRC for one and half years, thereby, exceeding the window  of three months  given by the expert committee.The senior BJP leader also said that the HC had asked MMRC to deposit Rs 2,600 crore to cater to the ownership claims in case of it getting established in future. The Kanjurmarg option was loaded with uncertainty and the risk of inordinate delay was at the centre of the physical implementation. Thus, an undisputed and unencumbered government land available for Metro car depot was allowed in December 2016, rather than depending on a disputed land where the claims of the private parties were also still undecided with potential liability of Rs 5,200 crore. Therefore, the state government allowed MMRC on December 31, 2016, to go for a depot at Aarey, wherein, 5 hectare land was to be retained as green, said Somaiya.The BJP leader added that work on another Metro line  Line 6 at JVLR is in progress with a proposed depot at Kanjurmarg. These two lines are separate systems where signalling and train systems are totally different and trains from one line cannot enter the other line for technical reasons. he said.Activist D Stalin also said that some people are creating a false narrative on Kanjurmarg land. He says the land is not disputed. This is a total lie of the BJP. This land belongs to the government. There was no litigation in 41 hectares of land out of the 500 acres. There was a part of land under contention and the owner even went up to the court, and the court had said that this was free land and he should not allow a third party intervention.The activist added that the figure of Rs 4,000 crore too is all made up. The government has made a great decision and we are happy with it. This decision will benefit the people as the line will be extended which will help east-west connectivity, he added.",2020-10-12

161,"Hathras case: HC chides UP ADG, victim's kin maintain stand in court | 10 points","The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Monday reportedly chided the UP Police for cremating the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died after allegedly being raped by four upper-caste men in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras in the middle of the night.According to the counsel for the victim's family, the Bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Rajan Roy asked ADG (Law and Order), Prashant Kumar, if he would have allowed his daughter to be cremated the same way? The court also questioned if the police action would have been similar if the victim came from a rich family, the counsel told media after the hearing.The HC bench had summoned UP Additional Chief Secretary, DGP, Hathras DM and SP, apart from the ADG (Law and Order). The victim's family also appeared before the court to record their statement.The victim's family urged the court to transfer the case out of the state as they did not have faith in the local authorities. They requested for security till the end of the judicial procedure and also demanded that reports of CBI be kept confidential.The District Magistrate of Hathras Praveen Kumar Laxkar, who also appeared before the court, accepted that it was his decision to cremate the victims body in the night. He said it was done to control the law and order situation. The court has fixed the next hearing in the matter on November 2.1) What is the case?The case related to the horrific gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly raped by four upper caste men on September 14. She succumbed to severe assault injuries at a Delhi hospital a fortnight later, which was followed by a hushed up cremation at night, allegedly forced by the district administration.The brutal injuries suffered by the woman and the administration's move to cremate her body late at night triggered massive outrage, resulting in a pitched political battle from Delhi to Hathras.""Shocked"" by the murder and alleged gang rape of the Dalit woman and the subsequent cremation, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court had on October 1 summoned top government officials.Also read | Hathras case: Who is probing what?2) Who was summoned?The court had summoned the Additional Chief Secretary, Home; the Director-General of Police; ADG, Law and Order; and the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police of Hathras to furnish the status report of the investigation into the case. The court had also asked the victims family mother, father and three brothers to appear before it and submit their statements. All summoned parties appeared before the court on Monday and recorded their statements.3) What did the victims family say?Advocate Seema Kushwaha, who represented the victim's family in court, said that the family wanted the case to be transferred out of Uttar Pradesh.She said that the security of the family was a major concern because the family had already been receiving threats from various groups supporting the accused. The family urged the court to provide them security till the final conclusion of the trial as well as appeals.Seema Kushwaha also requested the court that information about investigations should be kept private so that the family's privacy is not compromised.The family told the court that the victim was cremated against their wishes and they were not allowed to attend the last rites.Also read | Victim's family refuses to leave for Lucknow at night, cites security issues4) What did Hathras DM say?In his defence, Hathras DM Praveen Kumar Laxkar claimed that the cremation was done to control law and order situation amid a heavy crowd.However, the victims family interjected and said there was a heavy police presence thus there was no question of the law and order situation getting out of control.5) What did UP govt say?Additional Advocate General VK Shahi, who represented the state authorities in the court, refused to divulge details of the proceedings and just said that the next date of hearing has been fixed for November 2. The court will give a verdict, VK Shashi said while addressing media outside the Lucknow bend of the Allahabad HC on Monday.6) What did the court say? According to Seema Kushwaha, the counsel for the victim's family, the court expressed displeasure over the administration's conduct in the matter. ""ADG Law and Order Prashant Kumar was aked 'if you had a daughter, would you allow the funeral to take place without seeing her body? ADG Law and Order was speechless. He was unable to answer any questions,"" she said.Talking to the media after the hearing, Seema Kushwaha, who had also represented Nirbhaya's family, said that the police robbed the victim's family of basic human rights, guaranteed to everyone equally - regardless of their caste or status.""During last rights, we sprinkle Ganga water on the body of the deceased. They burnt her with kerosene, robbing her of basic human rights,"" Seema Kushwaha said.7) SC to hear the matter on October 15Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has fixed the hearing in the matter on October 15. Earlier, the SC had sought a reply from the UP government on three things - What are the security arrangements made for the victims' family and the witnesses? Does the aggrieved family have an advocate? And what is the status of the trial in Allahabad High Court?The UP government is yet to submit its reply to the apex court. Law experts say that the UP government will probably file an affidavit giving maximum information on the basis of the hearing held in the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court and the continuous development.8) Rahul, Priyanka attack UP govtStepping up their attack on the Uttar Pradesh government over the Hathras case, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused it of being insensitive and unethical and said authorities are indulging in victim-blaming instead of putting criminals in jail.Rahul Gandhi launched a social media campaign, urging people, especially women, to speak up for the Hathras victim.""The government's attitude in the Hathras incident is inhuman and unethical. They are engaged in protecting the criminals rather than helping the victim's family,"" Rahul Gandhi said.""Let us take one step towards change, let us raise our voice against the injustice being done to women all over the country,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag ""SpeakUpForWomenSafety"".""It is not the government's job to help and protect the perpetrators of the crime but send them to jail and help the victim get justice. The Uttar Pradesh government is not doing its job and that is why I am being stopped,"" he said in a nearly two-minute video attached with his tweet., - #SpeakUpForWomenSafety pic.twitter.com/ZZQHzdSuaqCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said crimes against women are rising and instead of listening to the truth and the voice of the victim women, allegations are levelled against them and they are defamed. ""This is the most shameful and cowardly act,"" she said.""But the country's women will no longer remain silent. If one sister is victimised, then lakhs of others will raise their voice and stand with them. We will now take responsibility for our own safety. Now only women will have to take the responsibility of women safety,"" she also said in a tweet in Hindi... #SpeakUpForWomenSafety2/29) Faux Pas: CBI puts Hathras case FIR on website, removes within hoursThe CBI, which has taken over the investigation of the Hathras case, briefly made the FIR in the case public, in violation of a Supreme Court order that FIRs in cases of rape and sexual assault, including those against minors, should not be put in the public domain by police.The CBI uploaded the FIR on its website on Monday morning, however, hours later the probe agency removed the document.The uploaded copy of the FIR had withheld the name of the Hathras victim, concealed using a whitening ink, but it was decided to withdraw it from the public domain to avoid unnecessary controversy, sources told news agency PTI.In December 2018, a Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur directed the print and electronic media to not reveal the identity of victims of rape and sexual assault ""even in a remote manner"".The apex court said FIRs in cases of rape and sexual assault, including those against minors, should not be put in the public domain by police.10) SC admits plea by journalists' body over the arrest of Kerala scribeIn a related matter, the SC on Monday said that it would hear a plea filed by a journalists' organisation against the arrest of a scribe by UP Police in Mathura while he was on way to Hathras. The plea will be heard after four weeks.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde asked the petitioner to amend the petition and observed that they should approach the Allahabad High Court for the relief.The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) had filed a habeas corpus petition in the top court against the arrest of the journalist, Sidhique Kappan.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench that Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act charges have been added in the case and no court in the state will give his client any relief.Also read | ED clarifies Bhim Army has no links with PFI, claims of Rs 100 crore pumped for Hathras protest false""UAPA has been invoked.

Sibal then sought time to amend the petition after which the matter was adjourned.(With inputs from PTI)",2020-10-12

163,"Parvathy resigns from AMMA, lashes out at Edavela Babu","Malayalam actress Parvathy Thiruvothu took to social media to announce her resignation from AMMA ( Association of Malayalam Movie Artists) with immediate effect. The decision came a day after AMMA General Secretary Edavela Babu's interview with a Malayalam news channel, in which he made a remark about her friend and actress Bhavana.In the interview, when Edavela Babu was asked if Bhavana would also be a part of the project made by members of the AMMA association, he said, ""Just like we can't bring back those who are dead, we can only make films with those who are in AMMA. She's not in AMMA and that's all I can say.""His comments didn't go down well with many celebrities including Parvathy Thiruvothu, who is a good friend of actress Bhavana. Parvathy took to social media to announce her resignation from the actor's body and said that she had abandoned all hope that changes would take place within the association. He slammed Edavela for his insensitive comment.Parvathy wrote, ""In her letter posted on her social media pages, Parvathy said, ""In 2018, when my friends resigned from A.M.M.A, I stayed back thinking at least a few should continue to work within a broken system and help repair it. But after watching A.M.M.A General Secretary speaks to Reporter TV's Nikesh Kumar, I have abandoned all hope that anything will ever change within this association. His utterly disgusting and mortifying remark comparing a woman member who had been badly let down by this organisation and consequently left it, to a dead person is beyond correction (sic).""She added, ""Mr. Babu may believe he just used a metaphor, but it shows his nauseating attitude and I pity him. I am sure that when the media starts discussing this remark, many of his peers will support him. Im certain about this because of the way they have always dealt with issues pertaining to women. I would like to resign from A.M.M.A with immediate effect. Moreover, I strongly demand the resignation of Mr.Edavela Babu. I hope other conscientious members will also demand for the same, and I will be keenly watching to see who will come forward. I urge every member to see that its a hazy bubble of welfare thats wrapped around a core of corrupt morals (sic).""Here's the post: It is worth mentioning that Bhavana had quit from the actor's body in 2018.

While Amitabh Bachchan urged everyone to keep calm, Raveena Tandon encouraged people to have a 'candle lit lunch' and 'chillax'. The most hilarious reaction perhaps, was of Kunal Kemmu. The Lootcase actor took to Instagram and posted a short video in which he compared what happens in other states when the light goes off and what happens in Mumbai.The video begins with the words 'When electricity goes in anywhere but Mumbai', flashing on the screen. Moments later, we see Kunal Kemmu, speaking in a thick Haryanvi accent, asking about when the power will be back.

165,"AI-driven 'deep fakes' next big tool of Chinese disinformation campaign, says study ","China is likely to rely on artificial intelligence-generated disinformation content, such as deep fake and deep voice videos, as part of its psychological and public opinion warfare across the world, a new study by United States-based think tank Atlantic Council says.The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensics Lab (DFRLab) has published a new study analysing Chinese disinformation campaigns and recent trends which suggest that despite high success among the domestic audience base, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) struggles to drive its message home on the foreign front.The study notes that so far, Chinese disinformation operations on western social media platforms have been ineffective due to flawed implementation, which includes outsourcing the operation to third parties.Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google have been able to identify Chinese campaigns and take timely actions in the past. But now, experts at DFRLab assess that ""AI will be used to employ effective, large-scale disinformation campaigns and to covertly run authentic Western social media accounts"".The study comes amid a tense standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control. Even US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently addressed the ""threat"" posed by China in the region.The Atlantic Council study observes the continuous shift in Beijing's foreign policy from its earlier ""non-intervention"" stance in the affairs of other countries. China now looks to exercise ""Discourse Power"" - a concept which suggests that a country can attain increased geo-political power by setting agendas internationally through influencing the political order and values, both domestically and in other countries, to project its ""peaceful"" rise as a global superpower.CCP has been using the information space, both domestically and internationally, to project the ""China Story"". The author of the study, Alicia Fawcett, describes it as projecting its positive image through storytelling in the media landscape, both domestic and abroad.Information perception tactics such as removal, suppression and downplay of negative information, as well as gamification of certain hashtags, are tools with which China intends to convince foreign audiences that it is a ""responsible world leader"" and leading power in reforming the international political system. Today's Internet-driven global information space offers Beijing an effective way to spread the ""China Story"" across the globe.The Chinese government infrastructure has been busy with large-scale operations of producing and reproducing false or misleading information with the intention to deceive. The content usually relies on psychological bias, provoking ethnic, racial or cultural affiliations within its target audience and intends to implant ""paranoia and cognitive blind-spots"".""China sees disinformation operations as an effective strategy for its governmentto achieve foreign policy objectives,"" Fawcett says and points out that the People's Liberation Army (PLA), State Council, and CCP's Central Committee all take part in organised information operations on domestic and international platforms.Deep fakes are synthetic multimedia where a person's original voice or appearance is manipulated to attribute the words they didn't say or an act they didn't perform. AI-driven deep fakes make the manipulated media flawless and easy to create which deceive viewers into believing the events that didn't take place.Some popular examples of deep fake videos are of Mark Zuckerberg and Barrack Obama where researchers and artists demonstrated the possible misuse of the technology.Deep voice media on the other hand relies on cloning a person's voice using machine-learning which could be used to create an entirely new speech in their original voice without consent or information. Since the use of deep fakes and deep voice on Chinese social media and artificial intelligence are not unprecedented, these tools figure prominently in Beijing's cyber warfare.The study observes the massive legwork done by popular Chinese apps and big tech firms such as TikTok, Baidu and Zao. It also mentions Baidu's recent Deep Voice project that can clone any voice in seconds. China could use these tools to create AI-driven mass deep fakes, which can be deployed as part of CCP's information operations.Several governments, including many US states, have sensed the threat and enacted laws against possible misuse of deep fakes. In India, there are no specific laws governing deep fakes as yet.Beijing's appetite for big data as a cyber and psychological warfare tool is no secret. The PLA's own academic journal, ""Military Correspondent"", had earlier published a commentary suggesting the use of AI-driven bot network by it.CCP's interest in big data seems to be heading towards analysis, detection, determination and handling of mass public sentiments. An article by China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Base 311, in charge of CCP's psychological warfare, had earlier stressed on the need for a ""voice information synthesis technology"". This technology was meant to identify a user's emotional sentiment and then conduct subliminal messaging.",2020-10-12
166,Did you know Khushbu Sundar can turn 25.71 degrees in a day?,"Did you know new entrant in the Bharatiya Janata Party Khushbu Sundar can turn an estimated 25.71 degrees in one day?Confused? Let us explain.Former Congress spokesperson and acclaimed actor Khushbu Sundar on Monday joined the BJP, hours after claiming she was ""suppressed"" in the Congress.Speaking to reporters at the joining ceremony, the actor from Tamil Nadu said she had come to the understanding over a period of time that if the nation has to move forward, then someone like Prime Minister Narendra Modi is needed to take the country ""in the right direction and to its glory"".""You have 128 crore people actually believing in one man and that's our prime minister. I think they're doing something absolutely right,"" she added.Khushbu Sundar joins BJP after resigning from Congress. #ITVideo#KhushbuSundar #Politics #Congress #BJP pic.twitter.com/d8YfsfNaymHowever, eight days ago Khushbu Sundar did not seem so confident of PM Modi's stewardship of the nation as well those who support him.On October 4 she tweeted, ""I know BJP has left the country's unemployment at its worst, but I am glad some of those desperate souls are employed by them to troll for Rs 2/- per abuse. But you know your auqaat (value) is sirf 2 rupaiyya na? I am happy I contribute atleast those 2 rupaiyya to your paapi pet (livelihood).""Between then and today she has made a 180-degree turn. Hence, a 25.71 degree per day rate of rotation.In fact, in the run-up to her joining the saffron party, Khushbu remained quite vocal about her disdain for the party especially in light of the Hathras gangrape and murder case and the Bihar elections.She posted and retweeted several tweets in praise of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visiting the family of the Hathras victim as well as his tractor rally in Punjab against the farm bills.On October 7 she once again seemed to show her aversion for PM Modi as she replied to someone on Twitter on the issue of Air India One (the Rs 8,400-crore plane that will from now ferry the prime minister and President of India).Khushbu said, ""You see Narendra Modi ji is the only PM this country has ever seen. Before him, India never had one. So we didn't see specially made aircrafts for PM. And the minute you agree you are a sanghi, you will never see the problems of a farmer, thus Farmers Bill 2020 is alien to you.""Then came multiple retweets of an article by American economist Joseph Stiglitz where he panned India's handling of the Covid-19 crisis.Interestingly, Khushbu Sundar joined the BJP on a day the Congress launched a nationwide campaign for women's safety. In what could be a teaser for the campaign, she tweeted on October 7 about the JDU fielding Muzzafarpur shelter home case accused Manju Verma in the Bihar elections.""Now this is the limit. She is out on bail and still an accused. Why this #BJP+JDU #sexghotalagathbandhan in Bihar??"" she asked.Then followed a series of non-political tweets.However, on October 10, the Tamil actor indicated a ""change"" was coming. Posting a photo of herself donning a saffron kurta, she wrote, ""Many see a change in me. Well as you age, you evolve and grow, learn and unlearn, perceptions change, likes and dislikes too, thoughts and ideas take a new shape, dreams are new, you understand the difference between like and love, between right and wrong. Change is inevitable. Happy eve.""Many see a change in me.

Moreover, the star batsman scored an extraordinary unbeaten 52-ball 90 in RCBs 37-run win over Chennai Super Kings, on Saturday, October 10.Cricketer turned commentator Kevin Pietersen couldnt stop praising Virat Kohli for the batsman and the performer that he is.

We keep talking about him so much is because of the way he batted the other night. He has done that for years, years and years. But he hadn't done that up until that points (90 not out against CSK).

169,Deep Dive | China's expanding DNA surveillance raises concern,"China is getting into the DNA of its citizens now. The growing genetic profile database of Chinese has left many worried, reigniting the debate on privacy. The Chinese government's genomic dataset likely contains around 140 million profiles, making it the world's largest DNA database.Intelligence agencies fear how China will leverage this one-of-its-kind database.Here's a quick recap.In 2003, China's ministry of public security started work on building a DNA database containing samples taken of suspects and criminals. This gradually expanded in its form and coverage thereby also including the minorities in China as well as majority citizens. Shockingly, they were not necessarily suspects or criminals, but ordinary citizens. In 2013, the Chinese government started collecting DNA samples from ethnic minority communities across Tibet and Xinjiang outside any criminal investigations and without proper informed consent.In 2013, Chinese government authorities started collecting biometric samples from people residing in what is commonly known as the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) under the pretext of offering a free annual physical checkup for residents. Reports indicate that almost 80 per cent (3 million residents) of the population was covered in this exercise. A similar programme was rolled out in Xinjiang in 2016, where data from nearly all the region's 23 million residents was collected.Speaking exclusively to India Today on the genomic surveillance in China and Tibet, Lobsang Gyatso Sither, the digital security program director at Tibet Action Institute, said, ""According to reports by the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, the collection of genetic samples has been completed in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), however, the status of the collection of data in Tibet outside of TAR is not clear. And, the question of at what stage the mapping process is at is not known.""In Xinjiang and Tibet, the DNA collection was not the only element. The multimodal approach also included high-definition photos, voice samples, fingerprints and iris scans of people ultimately linked to their personal information in police databases. All these data points were collected without consent or proper reasoning. The 360-degree surveillance of the minorities is made possible with such data points combined with an extensive system of security cameras and intrusive monitoring of local families.The success of these exercises encouraged its expansion across China. On November 9, 2017, the ministry of public security convened a meeting in Zhengzhou to discuss plans for a nationwide database of Y-STR-the 'short tandem repeat' or unique DNA sequences that occur on the male (Y) chromosome.When asked about the implications of DNA profiling of ordinary citizens in China, Emile Dirks, a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto and one of the authors of the ASPI report on Genomic Surveillance, told India Today: ""Under China's authoritarian political system, political dissent is a crime. China's ministry of public security plays two roles: maintaining social stability and ensuring the continuing rule of the Communist Party. In that sense, ""effective policing"" in China means the elimination of political dissent. This new system of genomic surveillance could be put to this use, in addition to investigating non-political crimes.""Dirks' research focuses on policing, drugs, detention and surveillance in China.""Chinese citizens can be beaten and tortured by local police, even when their supposed offences are non-political. And because of China's authoritarian political system, there are even fewer institutional constraints on police power than might exist in more politically open regimes. It is therefore likely that China's police will be free to use this new programme of genomic surveillance for whatever purpose they see fit, and that this programme will deepen the authority the ministry of public security over Chinese society,"" he said.The biomedical and biotechnology industry is putting a lot of effort into building systems that enable genetic surveillance and hence is benefitting a lot financially. Top Chinese and multinational companies are providing logistical and technical support to the Chinese security agencies via equipment and intellectual property necessary to collect, store and analyse the DNA samples.Thermo Fisher Scientific, a US-based biomedical and bioinformatics company, was said to be a key player during the initial years. Thermo, along with dozens of Chinese companies, has played major parts in building the infrastructure required to carry out such exercises.Many American lawmakers and human rights groups voiced their concerns against these corporates and the implications of their solutions and products in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet. Owing to public and governmental pressures, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2019 said it will no longer sell or service genetic sequencers in China's mostly Muslim region of Xinjiang.The company said it recognised the importance of considering how products ""are used - or may be used - by our customers.""The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies have long-standing concerns that China could use the DNA databases to develop bioweapons engineered to kill specific populations or even individuals. It could be a targeted genocide, they fear.Two years ago, Agent Ed You told a US commission on ""safeguarding the bioeconomy"" that the FBI's weapons of mass destruction directorate were developing countermeasures to prevent adversaries from acquiring and exploiting material and technology that may pose a national security concern.Agent You expressed concerns about the US companies working with Chinese partners in the area of genomics and genetic mapping - where the objective is to develop new medicines that target particular genetic types.He also addressed the possibility of large amounts of the US DNA data that might be ""exfiltrated"" to China. This was owing to reports back than of large-scale of hacking of the US health databases by Chinese non-state actors. Such concerns induced US senators, Charles Grassley and Marco Rubio, in writing to the US department of health expressing concerns about genomic data being collected by companies in the US with links to China.Emile Dirks opines that ""in general, I believe any company or research institute has a duty to ensure that their activities do not contribute to human rights abuses. Given what we know about police repression and genomic surveillance in China, this would certainly be the case with any company or researcher working in that country.""As against the wholesale approach adopted in Tibet and Xinjiang, Chinese officials use a more cost-efficient method in other parts of the country via collection of DNA samples from shortlisted males. This specific and targeted approach collects Y-STR data, unique DNA sequences on the male (Y) chromosome.This data enables the security agencies to link DNA samples of any person with a specific family or an individual. Officials can even chart family trees that span generations.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report estimates that, since late 2017, authorities across China have sought to collect DNA samples from 5-10 per cent of the country's male population, or roughly 35-70 million people.Unlike autosomal STR data, that is present in the DNA of both males and females, Y-STRs are found only in male DNAs. This is passed directly from father to son and do not undergo recombination with successive generations. Hence, they show little variation throughout apart from random mutations. This helps to identify and link men who share the same family as the Y-STR profile of a man will be nearly identical to that of his patrilineal male blood relatives. Combine these inferences with strong surveillance data and family information, and one can easily link the DNA samples to an actual person.Hence, this is a more cost-effective approach when compared to collection samples from all residents of a region.Reports indicate that authorities in Henan province were able to achieve a whopping 98.71 per cent genetic coverage of the province's total male population by collecting Y-STR samples from only 10 per cent of the province's men. Similar coverages were seen across other provinces.The mass and nonconsensual collection of DNAs from ordinary citizens and minorities blatantly violate the existing Chinese domestic laws and international norms governing the collection, use and storage of human genetic data.Speaking about the misuse of biometric and DNA information, Lobsang Gyatso Sither said, ""I believe that with any data collection, there is a space for misuse, however, it depends on what kind of process and policies are in place so that data is not misused. In the case of China, with no such requirements or policies in place, in the words of Kai-Fu Lee, a booster of Chinese AI, has argued that China has an advantage in developing A.I. because its leaders are less fussed by ""legal intricacies"" or ""moral consensus.""As such it is not a question of misusing this data but when and how. The question of how at the moment might be academic in a sense that how genetic mapping, combined with social data, biometric data and other such data collection will be used together, however, what is clear that it will be used for repression.""The Chinese state has a recorded history of using threats and violence against the families of critics of the government, economic offenders and those who fight against the oppression across minority regions.Xinjiang, Tibet and now Inner Mongolia are all seeing targeted oppression by the Chinese government. Leaked documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and The New York Times reveal that authorities in Xinjiang collect information on family members of detainees in the region's re-education camps, and a detainee's release is conditional upon the behaviour of their family members outside the camps. The family and relatives of those under the radar are routinely subjected to abuse and torture by local police authorities.The police authorities have direct access to the Y-STR database containing biometric samples and DNA information of people across China's patrilineal families. These will make it easy for the police to stamp dissidents and activism thereby further undermining the civil and human rights of activists and minorities.DNA phenotyping is a new and upcoming method that helps investigators predict the biogeographical characteristics of an unknown sample, such as hair and eye colour, skin pigmentation, geographical location, and age and tag them as Uyghurs or Tibetans accordingly. Scientists and groups across the world have warned that such techniques will lead to increased ethnic discrimination in an already oppressed society.Emile Dirks adds that ""there is evidence that Chinese researchers, working with representatives from Public Security Bureaus across China, are continuing to explore new forensic techniques related to the policing of Tibetans and Uyghurs.""1. Legal violation:Existing Chinese laws do not allow for such collection and use of genetic data. This also violates international laws and regulations pertaining to the use of genetic data.In 2015, Kuwait passed a law mandating DNA profiling of its entire population. Foreigners living in Kuwait and even visitors were to be included. Kuwait's Constitutional Court overruled the 2015 law two years later, because of concerns about how the database could be used in violations of privacy and due process.A similar incident also happened in Kenya where a national biometric database was asked to exclude DNA profiles by Kenya's High Court. Hence, DNA is now excluded from the Kenyan government's efforts to collect biometric data.2. No consent:Nonconsensual collection and use of genetic and biometric information completely strip apart any form of privacy for citizens. There are multitude of ways in which such information can be misused against minorities or individuals in China.Geneticist Yves Moreau, engineer and professor at the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, spoke to NPR's Scott Simon on the genomic surveillance.He says, ""I'm extremely concerned about this because in history, if you look back in the first half of the 20th century, German and then Belgian colonists in Rwanda and Burundi actually went there, and they were using pseudoscientific ideas about race and assigned people to a particular ethnicity. That was a significant factor in genocides. And the risk for this in the midterm is actually really worrying.""3. Privacy:Sensitive and private information like genetic mapping can say a lot about a person. There are numerous ways in which it can be misused. For instance, here's what a computational biologist from Boston, Massachusetts (quoted anonymously upon request), has to say about the implications in terms of privacy: ""Genomic information can be used to determine the risk for various diseases and based on that insurance companies could deny insurance because of ""preexisting conditions"". All in all, DNA is extremely rich and private information and can be misused in a whole lot of ways.""Lobsang Gyatso Sither adds: ""The Chinese government has a track record of using any kind of data for repression, censorship and surveillance and as such any collection of data of Tibetans, Uyghurs and even Chinese citizens must be condemned and stopped unless the Chinese government is able to show that they will follow due process and adherence at the very least to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights before collecting such data.""(The writer is a Singapore-based Open-Source Intelligence analyst)",2020-10-12
170,Meghan Markle says she was the most-trolled person in 2019,"Meghan Markle recently opened up about the criticism she has faced and the damage it has had on her mental health. During a recent interview, the Duchess of Sussex called herself the most-trolled person in the entire world in 2019.Meghan talked about the trolling and its effect on her emotional health along with her husband, Prince Harry. They spoke on a podcast called Teenager Therapy on mental health awareness, removing the stigma around the issue and how we can all contribute to a healthier world.WHAT DID MEGHAN MARKLE SAY?Meghan said on the podcast, ""I'm told that in 2019 I was the most trolled person in the entire world-male or female. Now eight months of that I wasn't even visible. I was on maternity leave or with a baby but what was able to just be manufactured and churned out, it's almost unsurvivable. That's so big you can't even think about what that feels like. I don't care if you're 15 or 25, if people are saying things about you that aren't true what that does to your mental and emotional health is so damaging.""She added, ""Even though our experience is unique to us and obviously can seem very different to what people experience on the day to day, it's still a human experience and that's universal. We all know what it feels like to have our feelings hurt. We all know what it feels like to be isolated or othered.""WHAT DID PRINCE HARRY SAY?Prince Harry also opened up about bullying and having a choice of cutting out hate from our lives.""It's very easy to be sucked in and consumed by negativity but we all have a choice to be able to cut that out of our lives. Hate-following has become a thing. We don't need to do that...for me I made the choice not to read it, not to see it and to remove myself from that and to very much focus on the uplifting and hopeful side which most of that I get from your generation,"" he said.For the podcast, the couple had joined a couple of teens to raise awareness for World Mental Health Day on Saturday.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had announced in January that they would be stepping down as senior Royal members of the British Royal family.Listen to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's entire conversation here:ALSO READ: Meghan Markle's Suits co-star Patrick J Adams is scared to call her: I think I'm intimidatedALSO READ: Donald Trump takes a dig at Meghan Markle: Im not her fan, but I wish luck to Harry.

175,Sachin Tendulkar says RCB's Chahal was 'playing chess' against MS Dhoni in Dubai,"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) needed 81 runs off 34 balls when MS Dhoni came in to bat against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Saturday in match 25 of IPL 2020 in Dubai. Sam Curran, Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja were still to bat and so the onus was again on MS Dhoni to take charge and take his team over the winning line. Dhoni had faced a lot of crticism already because of bad run with the bat in the 13th edition of the cash-rich league and so pressure was straight away on him.There was also not much time when Dhoni walked in and actions were required from the ball go. Yuzvendra Chahal was introduced just 4 balls after the CSK captain's arrival. Chahal bowled a good length on the off-stum line to start with as Dhoni took a single. The 3rd ball of the over was right under Dhoni's arc and he grabbed the opportunity to hit a straight six.We shoud pause here for a while and instead take a look at how Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar has described this over. We are just mortals following this game passionately and we stand no where close to the explanations given by the 'God' of cricket himself.Sachin Tendulkar has said that Yuzvendra Chahal 'played chess with MS Dhoni' in the over.Describing the second ball after the one which went for six, Tendulkar has said that the RCB leg-spinner bowled the delivery with minimal pace on the leg-stump line. The slow pace by Chahal according to Sachin Tendulkar was in expectation to get a top-edge from MS Dhoni. Tendulkar said that Dhoni understood what Chahal was trying to do and hence just blocked the ball. It was at this point that Sachin realised that Chahal was 'playing chess' with the former India captain.""When MS Dhoni came to bat then Chahal came in front of him. He gave the first ball in the arc of Dhoni and he effortlessly hit a six and that's his strength. He changed the line on the next ball. He bowled it towards the leg-stump and also he kept the pace slow, expecting that it would take a top-edge and there will be a chance. MS Dhoni realised it and blocked the ball. but then he also started thinking. I think Chahal was playing chess with MS Dhoni, he was playing mind games,"" the former Mumbai Indians batsman said.Further, Tendulkar explained that Dhoni anticapted a same length delivery on the next ball and so he moved a bit towards the leg-stump to get in line of the ball but Chahal again came up with his chess move and bowled the ball towards off, making it hard for Dhoni to reach the ball. The result of Chahal's ""mind game"" was that Dhoni couldn't get any power on the shot and was caught by Gurkeerat Singh on long-off.""MS Dhoni then decided that he would move towards the leg-stump and come line with the ball to play that length on the next delivery but Chahal again used a chess move there and bowled the ball wide of MS Dhoni towards the off-stump. MS Dhoni had to stretch him to reach there, he reached the ball but ball hit in the bottom half of the bat and so he could not generate that power in the shot. Long-off fielder took a catch. These mind games between the two were interesting. Did not go on for long but it was good. Chahal it was a chess move.""Wickets fell consistently for CSK after that and the team slummped to their 5th defeat in the IPL 2020 season.",2020-10-12

Urging the state government to think twice about its decision, the clerics said that general education is provided along with religious education in the Madrasas.The Madrasas are running in Assam since before the independence of the country. Lakhs of students have enrolled in the Madrasas and many have already passed. If the government will close down the Madrasas, then these students' life will be spoiled.
